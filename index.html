After marrying in 1970, they moved to California, where Terry earned her doctorate in marine ecology at the University of Southern California and Gerry earned his doctorate in neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology. As postdoctoral students at the University of Washington&#39;s marine laboratories, they worked together on the neural bases of behavior, using a marine mollusk as a model system. Terry and Gerry are now professors of biology at the University of Colorado at Denver, where they have taught introductory biology and neurobiology since 1982. In their research lab, funded by the National Institutes of Health, they investigate the mechanisms by which neurons are harmed by low levels of environmental pollutants. Terry and Gerry share a deep appreciation of nature and of the outdoors. They enjoy hiking in the Rockies, running near their home in the foothills west of Denver, and attempting to garden at 7000 feet in the presence of hungry deer and elk. They are long-time members of many conservation organizations. Their daughter, Heather, has added another focus to their lives. &#34;Bruce E. Byers,&#34; a midwesterner transplanted to the hills of western Massachusetts, is a professor in the biology department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He&#39;s been a member of the faculty at UMass (where he also completed his doctoral degree) since 1993. Bruce teaches introductory biology courses for both nonmajors and majors; he also teaches courses in ornithology and animal behavior. A lifelong fascination with birds ultimately led Bruce to scientific exploration of avian biology. His currentresearch focuses on the behavioral ecology of birds, especially on the function and evolution of the vocal signals that birds use to communicate. The pursuit of vocalizations often takes Bruce outdoors, where he can be found before dawn, tape recorder in hand, awaiting the first songs of a new day.</p><h2>Statistical Methods for Engineers</h2><p>STATISTICAL METHODS FOR ENGINEERS offers a balanced, streamlined one-semester introduction to Engineering Statistics that emphasizes the statistical tools most needed by practicing engineers.

Lost for many years, the photographs were rediscovered in the attic of Harvard&#x2019;s Peabody Museum in 1976. In the first narrative history of these images, Molly Rogers tells the story of the photographs, the people they depict, and the men who made and used them. Weaving together the histories of race, science, and photography in nineteenth-century America, Rogers explores the invention and uses of photography, the scientific theories the images were intended to support and how these related to the race politics of the time, the meanings that may have been found in the photographs, and the possible reasons why they were &#x201c;lost&#x201d; for a century or more. Each image is accompanied by a brief fictional vignette about the subject&#x2019;s life as imagined by Rogers; these portraits bring the seven subjects to life, adding a fascinating human dimension to the historical material.</p></p><p><b>Molly Rogers</b> has published essays on the history of photography, and her fiction has been produced for theater and radio. She lives in the UK, where she teaches creative writing.*Starred Review* In 1976, researchers came across a cache of unidentified photographs in Harvard&#x2019;s Peabody Museum. What was unusual was that the photographs, dating from an era when only the wealthy could afford to have portraits done, were of seven African Americans&#x2014;likely slaves&#x2014;taken in the nude. Research revealed that the photos were taken in 1850 in Columbia, South Carolina, under the direction of the famous naturalist Louis Agassiz. The Swiss scientist immigrated to the U.S. to teach at Harvard, lecture around the nation, and encourage the study of natural history, supporting a controversial theory that the races were the product of separate creations. The photographs of the slaves, including a woman whose enigmatic gaze is soul stirring, were apparently part of Agassiz&#x2019;s research efforts. Breakthroughs in photography came at the same time as heated debate about theories of physiognomy, the reading of character in human faces, and eugenics, with its disputes about single or multiple origins of humans. Rogers draws on archives and historical records for the facts of slavery, photography, and science of the period. For the imagined lives of the slaves&#x2014;who left no written record&#x2014;she draws on the writings of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and Toni Morrison, among others. Rogers begins each chapter with a vignette imagining the lives of the slaves who were photographed as she explores the intersections of power, ideology, and imaging. This fascinating book includes the rediscovered photographs as well as others of major figures of the era. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Exercises in Style (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>A new edition of a French modernist classic - a Parisian scene told ninety-nine different ways - with new material written in homage by the likes of Jonathan Lethem, Rivka Galchen, and many more.</strong></p><p>On a crowded bus at midday, Raymond Queneau observes one man accusing another of jostling him deliberately. When a seat is vacated, the first man appropriates it. Later, in another part of town, Queneau sees the man being advised by a friend to sew a new button on his overcoat.</p><p><em>Exercises in Style</em> &#x2015; Queneau&#x2019;s experimental masterpiece and a hallmark book of the Oulipo literary group &#x2015; retells this unexceptional tale ninety-nine times, employing the sonnet and the alexandrine, onomatopoeia and Cockney. An &#x201c;Abusive&#x201d; chapter heartily deplores the events; &#x201c;Opera English&#x201d; lends them grandeur. Queneau once said that of all his books, this was the one he most wished to see translated. He offered Barbara Wright his &#x201c;heartiest congratulations,&#x201d; adding: &#x201c;I have always thought that nothing is untranslatable.Here is new proof.&#x201d;</p><p>To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the 1947 French publication of <em>Exercises de Style</em>, New Directions has asked several writers to contribute new exercises as a tribute. Tantalizing examples include Jonathan Lethem&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cyberpunk,&#x201d; Harry Mathew&#x2019;s &#x201c;Phonetic Eros,&#x201d; and Frederic Tuten&#x2019;s &#x201c;Beatnik&#x201d; exercises. This edition also retains Barbara Wright&#x2019;s original introduction and reminiscence of working on this book &#x2015; a translation that in 2008 was ranked first on the Author&#x2019;s Society&#x2019;s list of &#x201c;The 50 Outstanding Translations of the Last 50 Years.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond Queneau</strong> (1903-1976) is acknowledged as one of the most influential of modern French writers, having helped determine the shape of twentieth-century French literature, especially in his role with the Oulipo, a group of authors that includes Italo Calvino, Georges Perec, and Harry Mathews, among others.</p><p><b>Barbara Wright</b> has translated several Raymond Queneau novels; indeed, as John Updike wrote in <i>The New Yorker</i>, she "has waltzed around the floor with the Master so many times by now that she follows his quirky French as if the steps were in English." She has also translated works by Alain Robbe-Grillet, Robert Pinget, Nathalie Sarraute, and Marguerite Duras. She lives in London.</p>&#x201c;Queneau&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Exercises in Style&nbsp;</em>is a thrilling masterpiece and, in fact, one of the greatest stories in French literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Vladimir Nabokov</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Exercises in Style</em> was a revolution, a book that proclaimed its powerful ideas simply by pursuing their iron logic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What makes the book compelling is seeing this same, banal tale told through a huge variety of literary styles, from science fiction to rhyme, haiku to official letter. The variety in its repetition becomes at first odd, then hilarious as more and more absurd forms are chosen.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Huffington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This witty, bizarre read is perfect for dipping into, or reading from cover to cover, for anybody who loves storytelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Huffington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It will remind you of just how weird and infinite human language is.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Raphael Rubinstein, <em>BOMBlog</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Exercises in Style</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an irresistibly simple and frequently hilarious demonstration of the potential of language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Believer Logger</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Exercises in Style</em>&nbsp;turns the current thinking about writing entirely, and brilliantly, on its head.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Yuka Igarashi, <em>The New Inquiry</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a testament to Queneau&#x2019;s ability as a writer, and just as interestingly, it sort of blows apart the idea of how many ways a story can be told&#x2015;and how style can be more important than content.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chad W.

This attractive collection gathers more than 150 of her memorable works. Featuring insights about nature, love, life, death and immortality, these poems are among the best loved in English literature.</p><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Archibald MacLeish has noted the &#34;curious energy&#34; which pervades Emily Dickinson&#39;s work. She, along with Walt Whitman, helps make up the very foundation of American poetry. This Modern Library edition from Random House is an excellent overview of Dickinson&#39;s work, divided by theme, including &#34;Life,&#34; &#34;Nature,&#34; &#34;Love,&#34; and so forth. This volume of selected poems is a must for any serious reader of American poetry.Emily Dickinson lived as a recluse in Amherst, Massachusetts, dedicating herself to writing a &#34;letter to the world&#34;--the 1,775 poems left unpublished at her death in 1886. Today, Dickinson stands in the front rank of American poets. This enthralling collection includes more than four hundred poems that were published between Dickinson&#39;s death and 1900. They express her concepts of life and death, of love and nature, and of what Henry James called &#34;the landscape of the soul.&#34; And as Billy Collins suggests in his Introduction, &#34;In the age of the workshop, the reading, the poetry conference and festival, Dickinson reminds us of the deeply private nature of literary art.&#34;</p><h2>The Hobbit</h2><p>&#39;The Hobbit&#39; is a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarves in search of dragon-guarded gold.

He is the author of numerous</strong> <strong>books, including </strong><strong><em>Red Earth, White Lies</em></strong> (1995), <em>God is</em> <em>Red</em> (1973), and <em> Custer Died for your Sins</em> (1969).<strong>James</strong> <strong>Treatteaches in the Honors College at the University of</strong> <strong>Oklahoma. He edited </strong><strong><em>Native and Christian: Indigenous</em></strong> <strong></strong><strong><em>Voices on Religious Identity in the United States and</em></strong> <strong></strong><strong><em>Canada</em></strong>, also published by Routledge.In The Red Man in the New World Drama, Native American activist, lawyer and religious leader Deloria trenchantly declared, "While America has produced great businessmen and scientists, it has been unable to produce one great philosopher or theologian." Though controversial, Deloria's writings have challenged continually the ways that religious thinkers understand the relationship between the practices of American religion native and imported. From the beginning of the American experiment, Deloria notes, the unique beliefs and rituals of indigenous American religion have been replaced by the polity and practice of European Christianity. To return to the values of a distinctly American religion, he asserts, means recognizing that the American land serves as the fountain of human existence and the standard of religious revelation in this place. Deloria gathers in this collection of essays from 1965 to 1995 his most forthright reflection and writing on American religion, nicely divided into five sections examining such topics as "The Theological Dimension of the Indian Protest Movement," "Religion and the Modern American Indian," "Sacred Lands and Religious Freedom," and "Is Religion Possible?: An Evaluation of Present Efforts to Revive Traditional Tribal Religions." In his afterword to this volume, Deloria declares that the "old mainstream churches have hardly any relevancy for our time." Although he has sought unity between American Christianity and Native American religion for many years, he disdains religious expressions by either community that substitute the form of religious practice for an experience of the substance of the sacred. Finally, throughout these essays Deloria emphasizes, as he said in God Is Red, "Religion cannot be kept within the bounds of sermons and scriptures. It is a force in and of itself and it calls for the integration of lands and people in harmonious unity." Deloria's forceful and important essays deserve a wide reading. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The White Rhino Hotel: A Novel</h2><p>Historic romance and adventure do not get any better than in this companion novel to the top-selling A Caf� on the Nile. The Great War has ended, tragically for many, but for some, Africa holds the prospect of vast estates, fabulous wealth, and limitless opportunity in this powerful, wonderfully crafted novel of the natural and human perils that await pioneers in a promised land. In colonial Kenya the paths of these new settlers cross at Lord Penfold&#39;s White Rhino Hotel. Here they meet the cunning dwarf Olivio Alevado, a man whose lustful desires and vengeful schemes make him a formidable adversary to his enemies and a subtle ally to his friends. Here the destinies of the gypsy adventurer Anton Rider and courageous, war-hardened Gwen Llewelyn intersect. Here hope is corrupted by greed, love by revenge, and loyalty by betrayal as the future is trampled into history. &#34;A wing-ding adventure story.... The kind of book that creates one of the elemental delights of fiction - a complete other world where, unlike our own, all the parts add up to something.&#34; - Boston Globe; &#34;A genuine epic centered in Africa, by a writer who knows how to write, who knows his terrain intimately, who knows how to paint his characters convincingly, and who knows how to spin a good yarn.&#34; - Forbes Magazine.</p><p><p><strong>Bartle Bull</strong> is the author of the widely praised African novels <em>The White Rhino Hotel</em>, <em>A Cafe on the Nile</em>, and <em>The Devil's Oasis</em>. He is a member of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club and was the publisher of the <em> Village Voice</em>.</p>First fiction, set at the end of WW I, in which a frontier Kenyan hotel provides rest, shelter, and large drinks to a fugitive Gypsy, wounded Tommies, murderous Irishmen, scheming Portuguese colonials, displaced Germans, an American cowboy, and a pretty Welsh woman. Bull's nonfiction Safari (1988) covered some of the same geography. Having sold the bulk of his British estate and mismanaged his plantation ventures, Adam Penfold finds that his fortune has dwindled to the White Rhino, a hotel in the Kenyan highlands. Lord Penfold and his oppressively horsy lady Sissy preside over the place, leaving management to their major-domo Olivio, a dwarf whose spying and sexual skills are state of the art. As there is much to spy out and many itches to scratch, Olivio is a very busy man. The end of the war has brought a new wave of settlers to the colony, hopeful men and women who are about to find out that the rich Kenyan soils are very choosy about what crops they'll support and that the old Kenyan colonials can be as treacherous as the worst villains in Europe. Anton Rider, with his gypsy skills and restless intelligence, is one of the few immigrants truly suited to the whims of Africa. Dashing Anton has become smitten with Gwenn Llewellyn, who has joined her badly crippled husband to carve out a new life and who has already made a couple of very dangerous enemies in a pair of violent Irish brothers. Adam and Gwenn are made for each other, but before they sort things out, there are swamps to ford, savannahs to cross, dalliances to be enjoyed, pythons to wrestle, elephants to cook, and legal business to sort out. Very nicely done. Bull has sensibly resisted the temptation to turn his racy African adventures into a sweeping, gabby epic, so everything moves at a cracking pace. Much ground is covered, but since the time is short, the stories are well contained. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is divided into three parts: the first is introduced by a powerful prayer for the dead of 9/11; the second by a searching meditation on Martin Luther King Jr., and the last by a heart-wrenching eulogy for James Baldwin. In the writings and speeches included here, Morrison takes on contested social issues: the foreigner, female empowerment, the press, money, "black matter(s)," and human rights. She looks at enduring matters of culture: the role of the artist in society, the literary imagination, the Afro-American presence in American literature, and in her Nobel lecture, the power of language itself.

But none is foolish enough to give perceptive, dissident writers free range to publish their judgments or follow their creative instincts. They know they do so at their own peril. They are not stupid enough to abandon control (overt or insidious) over media. Their methods include surveillance, censorship, arrest, even slaughter of those writers informing and disturbing the public. Writers who are unsettling, call�ing into question, taking another, deeper look. Writers&#x2014;journalists, essayists, bloggers, poets, playwrights&#x2014;can disturb the social oppres�sion that functions like a coma on the population, a coma despots call peace, and they stanch the blood flow of war that hawks and profiteers thrill to.<br><br> That is their peril.<br><br> Ours is of another sort.<br><br> How bleak, unlivable, insufferable existence becomes when we are deprived of artwork. That the life and work of writers facing peril must be protected is urgent, but along with that urgency we should remind ourselves that their absence, the choking off of a writer&#x2019;s work, its cruel amputation, is of equal peril to us. The rescue we extend to them is a generosity to ourselves.<br><br> We all know nations that can be identified by the flight of writers from their shores. These are regimes whose fear of unmonitored writ�ing is justified because truth is trouble. It is trouble for the warmonger, the torturer, the corporate thief, the political hack, the corrupt justice system, and for a comatose public. Unpersecuted, unjailed, unha�rassed writers are trouble for the ignorant bully, the sly racist, and the predators feeding off the world&#x2019;s resources. The alarm, the disquiet, writers raise is instructive because it is open and vulnerable, because if unpoliced it is threatening. Therefore the historical suppression of writers is the earliest harbinger of the steady peeling away of additional rights and liberties that will follow. The history of persecuted writers is as long as the history of literature itself. And the efforts to cen�sor, starve, regulate, and annihilate us are clear signs that something important has taken place. Cultural and political forces can sweep clean all but the &#x201c;safe,&#x201d; all but state-approved art.<br><br> I have been told that there are two human responses to the per�ception of chaos: naming and violence. When the chaos is simply the unknown, the naming can be accomplished effortlessly&#x2014;a new species, star, formula, equation, prognosis. There is also mapping, charting, or devising proper nouns for unnamed or stripped-of-names geography, landscape, or population. When chaos resists, either by reforming itself or by rebelling against imposed order, violence is understood to be the most frequent response and the most rational when confronting the unknown, the catastrophic, the wild, wanton, or incorrigible. Rational responses may be censure; incarceration in holding camps, prisons; or death, singly or in war. There is, however, a third response to chaos, which I have not heard about, which is stillness. Such stillness can be passivity and dumbfoundedness; it can be paralytic fear. But it can also be art. Those writers plying their craft near to or far from the throne of raw power, of military power, of empire building and countinghouses, writers who construct mean�ing in the face of chaos must be nurtured, protected. And it is right that such protection be initiated by other writers. And it is impera�tive not only to save the besieged writers but to save ourselves. The thought that leads me to contemplate with dread the erasure of other voices, of unwritten novels, poems whispered or swallowed for fear of being overheard by the wrong people, outlawed languages flourishing underground, essayists&#x2019; questions challenging authority never being posed, unstaged plays, canceled films&#x2014;that thought is a nightmare. As though a whole universe is being described in invisible ink.<br><br> Certain kinds of trauma visited on peoples are so deep, so cruel, that unlike money, unlike vengeance, even unlike justice, or rights, or the goodwill of others, only writers can translate such trauma and turn sorrow into meaning, sharpening the moral imagination.<br><br> A writer&#x2019;s life and work are not a gift to mankind; they are its necessity.</p><h2>The Post-Colonial Critic: Interviews, Strategies, Dialogues</h2><p>Gayatri Spivak, one of our best known cultural and literary theorists, addresses a vast range of political questions with both pen and voice in this unique book. <strong></strong><strong><em>The Post-Colonial Critic</em></strong> brings together a selection of interviews and discussions in which she has taken part over the past five years; together they articulate some of the most compelling politico-theoretical issues of the present.<br> In these lively texts, students of Spivak's work will identify her unmistakeable voice as she speaks on questions of representation and self-representation, the politicization of deconstruction; the situations of post-colonial critics; pedagogical responsibility; and political strategies.</p><p>"A set of interviews that render Spivak's thought more accessible, "The Post-Colonial Critic could be considered a primer on constructing positionalities."<br>-"College Literature <br></p><h2>The Cycle of the Year as a Path of Initiation: Leading to an Experience of the Christ Being</h2><p><b>Now available in paperback</b><br><br>In ancient times, humanity possessed innate knowledge of the spiritual foundations of existence. Such knowledge could be acquired by inwardly following the cycle of the year and its great seasonal festivals. However, that instinctive knowledge had to be lost before human beings could discover real individual freedom. Today, as Sergei O. Prokofieff demonstrates in this comprehensive work, &#x201c;this knowledge must be found anew through the free, light-filled consciousness of the fully developed human personality.&#x201d;<br><br>Tracing the spiritual path of the yearly cycle, Prokofieff penetrates to the deeper esoteric realities of the seven Christian festivals of Michaelmas, Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and St John&#x2019;s Tide. Basing his research on the work of the twentieth-century initiate Rudolf Steiner, he reveals how those festivals are spiritual facts that exist independently of religious traditions and cultural customs.<br><br>Working with the festivals in an esoteric way can provide a true path of initiation, ultimately enabling an experience of the being of the Earth, Christ. The journey of study through this book can thus lead the reader to an experience of the modern Christian-Rosicrucian path, along which &#x201c;it is possible to take the first steps toward life in partnership with the course of cosmic existence.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Sergei O. Prokofieff</b> (1954-2014) was born in Moscow, where he studied fine arts and painting at the Moscow School of Art. At an early age he encountered the work of Rudolf Steiner and quickly realized that his life would be dedicated to the Christian path of esoteric knowledge.

Based on Scripture, this devotional is written as if God the Father is speaking His words of comfort and protection directly over you.<br><br>When Carol Kent&#x2019;s son was sentenced to life in prison without parole, Carol was consumed with grief, sadness, and despair. She was distraught wondering why God permitted this to happen. She had prayed for her son since he was a small child. He had been raised with biblical principles and daily prayer. As Carol tried to make sense of everything, she couldn&#x2019;t help asking, <i>Where&#x2019;s God when it hurts so much?</i><br><br>In the middle of her sorrow, Carol turned to the place where she had always gone for comfort&#x2015;the Bible. She was desperate to hear God&#x2019;s voice. She soon discovered that the best way for her to &#x201c;listen&#x201d; to His voice was to meditate on Scripture and then write out what she believed He was saying. She wrote it as if it was His prayer over her life, and it comforted her. It was as if He took her by the hand, as a father would guide a child, and He gently led her in the direction of unconditional love, renewed hope, and fresh faith.<br><br>Know without a doubt that God is with you and stands ready to protect and guide you. He holds your hand, and He won&#x2019;t let go. Listen to God&#x2019;s voice and put your hand in His. He is your Comforter, your Healer, your Teacher, and your Joy.

Now, she shares the encouragement she received from God.<br><br><i>Listen to God&#x2019;s voice in Scripture. Remember, He holds your hand, and He won&#x2019;t let go.</i>What a treasure we have in Carol Kent&#x2019;s book <i>He Holds My Hand! </i>A whole year of encouraging words from our heavenly Father&#x2019;s heart to our fragile one&#x2015;when we are hurting, helpless, or hope-deprived. Powerful words straight from the Word when our lives are chaotic, confusing, or complicated. Tender words that calm our souls. Faithful words that help us remember God&#x2019;s covenant of love. Challenging words, spoken directly to any who might listen and respond with fresh courage. Dig in, friend&#x2015;just one page a day&#x2015;and receive all God has for you through the vessel of a godly woman who has held tightly to His hand in every season of life. (Lucinda Secrest McDowell, author Ordinary Graces)<br><br>The more I dig into <i>He Holds My Hand</i>,the more I feel like I am walking in the light.

Zimmer brings the same story-telling skills he displayed in The Tangled Bank, his 2009 non-majors textbook that the Quarterly Review of Biology called &#34;spectacularly successful.&#34; Emlen, an award-winning evolutionary biologist at the University of Montana, has infused Evolution: Making Sense of Life with the technical rigor and conceptual depth that today&#39;s biology majors require. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of evolutionary theory, such as natural selection, genetic drift, phylogeny, and coevolution. Evolution: Making Sense of Life also drives home the relevance of evolution for disciplines ranging from conservation biology to medicine. With riveting stories about evolutionary biologists at work everywhere from the Arctic to tropical rain forests to hospital wards, the book is a rea</p><p>The New York Times Book Review calls Carl Zimmer as fine a science essayist as we have. Zimmer is the author of ten books, including Parasite Rex, which the Los Angeles Times called a book capable of changing how we see the world, and Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea, which Scientific American described as as fine a book as one will find on the subject. His 2009 textbook The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution, was named by Choice as an outstanding academic title of the year. Edward O. Wilson praised the book, saying, &#34;The Tangled Bank is the best written and best illustrated introduction to evolution of the Darwin centennial decade, and also the most conversant with ongoing research. It is excellent for students, the general public, and even other biologists.&#34; In addition to books, Zimmer also writes articles for the New York Times and magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, and Discover, where he is a contributing editor. His journalism has earned him numerous awards; he has won the National Academies Science Communication Award, and he is a two-time winner of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Journalism Award. He lectures regularly at universities and museums and is a frequent guest on radio programs such as This American Life, and RadioLab. Douglas J. Emlen is a professor at the University of Montana, where he conducts research on the evolution of animal development. After earning his Ph.D. at Princeton, he spent three years as a postdoctoral fellow at Duke University before coming to Montana. Emlen&#39;s research has earned him the Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering from the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, multiple research awards from the National Science Foundation, including their five-year CAREER award, and a Young Investigator Prize by the American Society of Naturalists. Emlen&#39;s research has been featured in outlets including The New York Times and National Public Radio&#39;s Fresh Air.

His writings--mosaics incorporating philosophy, literary criticism, Marxist analysis, and a syncretistic theology--defy simple categorization. And his mobile, often improvised existence has proven irresistible to mythologizers. His writing career moved from the brilliant esotericism of his early writings through his emergence as a central voice in Weimar culture and on to the exile years, with its pioneering studies of modern media and the rise of urban commodity capitalism in Paris. That career was played out amid some of the most catastrophic decades of modern European history: the horror of the First World War, the turbulence of the Weimar Republic, and the lengthening shadow of fascism. Now, a major new biography from two of the world's foremost Benjamin scholars reaches beyond the mosaic and the mythical to present this intriguing figure in full.</p><p>Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings make available for the first time a rich store of information which augments and corrects the record of an extraordinary life. They offer a comprehensive portrait of Benjamin and his times as well as extensive commentaries on his major works, including "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility," the essays on Baudelaire, and the great study of the German <i>Trauerspiel</i>. Sure to become the standard reference biography of this seminal thinker,<i> Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> will prove a source of inexhaustible interest for Benjamin scholars and novices alike.</p></p><p><p>Howard Eiland is an editor and translator of Benjamin&#x2019;s writings.</p><p>Michael W. Jennings is Class of 1900 Professor of Modern Languages at Princeton University.</p>&#x201c;[An] outstanding and monumental biography of Walter Benjamin... In the thoroughness of their account and the acuity and delicacy of their philosophical analyses, Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings have provided an indispensable sighting of Benjamin&#x2019;s achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Phelan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This] is a careful synthesis of all the available sources for Benjamin&#x2019;s life&#x2015;letters, diaries, reminiscences of friends&#x2015;with all of his major writings, to produce the comprehensive account that has been sorely lacking until now... <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> makes clear how intimately Benjamin&#x2019;s biography was shaped by the history of Europe during his lifetime.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Kirsch</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In their superb new biography, Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings have given us a portrait of this elusive but paradigmatic thinker that deserves to be ranked among the few truly indispensable intellectual biographies of the modern era. I am tempted to call it a masterpiece. Nearly seven hundred pages in length, this is not only a study of Benjamin&#x2019;s life, it is also a guide to the bewildering mix of themes and preoccupations that populated this most prolific and unfamiliar of minds... To write the biography of an intellectual is difficult business, since so much of what passes for an event is taking place only in the mind or on the page&#x2015;but those are the events that really matter. Eiland and Jennings move with deliberation through Benjamin&#x2019;s major works, expounding and explaining with uncommon lucidity even when the text in question is one of notorious difficulty. The result is not a mere chronicle of a life but also a reliable map into Benjamin&#x2019;s intellectual labyrinth.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter E. Gordon</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The most comprehensive biography we are ever likely to have of Benjamin... Both authors have spent close to a lifetime on the subject. The devotion and care evident in their account are clearly based on sympathy and admiration. Their exposition of Benjamin&#x2019;s thought is exemplary, their sleuthing about his personal life breathtaking. Definitive is an archaic and much abused term that Benjamin would have abhorred; suffice it to say that it is unlikely that anyone will ever be able to tell us more about this German-Jewish thinker or present that knowledge with greater stylistic aplomb.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Modris Eksteins</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Eiland and Jennings] argue compellingly that as a critic [Benjamin] not only reshaped our understanding of many important writers, but he recognized the potentials and hazards of technological media that revolutionized culture during his lifetime... An impressive work of exegesis... Indispensable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stuart Jeffries</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Serious and imposing, it seeks to gather up and bind the threads of Benjamin&#x2019;s career, unite the unpublished and the half-finished essays and book projects, weaving together a comprehensive biography both of the man and his thought. A great strength of <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i> is how it lays out Benjamin&#x2019;s major works as part of an evolution of thought, providing not only invaluable context to each piece, but tracing each work&#x2019;s central claims in a lucid and approachable manner. One need not be a PhD to approach this book, and it will intrigue anyone with a passing interest in the intellectual history of the 20th century. With key essays and books given substantive contextualization and explanation, Eiland and Jennings make Benjamin&#x2019;s work accessible and networked into a larger set of themes and concerns... As omnipresent as [Benjamin&#x2019;s] tragic fate is throughout the book, Eiland and Jennings also provide a host of surprising (and even delightful) details of Benjamin&#x2019;s life, which round out the melancholic caricature of him in favor of a complex, conflicted individual.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin Dickey</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Impressive... [Eiland and Jennings] portray their subject as a kind of ragpicker in the neglected alleyways of a culture in transition&#x2015;a specialist in the marginal and mundane, the fragmentary and forgotten... They succeed in offering not only the most comprehensive biography to date, but a <i>tour de force</i> introduction to an incomparably incandescent mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Benjamin Balint</b><b>, </b><b><i>Books &amp; Ideas</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings have rightly sought and successfully produced the thread that gives a biography of Benjamin the kind of weight and significance his influence deserves... Their curiosity in searching out an expanded wealth of details now available about Benjamin, both personal and intellectual, historical and anecdotal, has produced an account that enlivens the already well-known turning points in Benjamin&#x2019;s development... This biography far surpasses not just any preceding biographical history of Benjamin but in its searching out of what remains consistent in Benjamin it has found the thread that allows a narrative of life and work to unfold in a way that does not subordinate one to the other... This achievement will remain not only a standard and resource-full account of Benjamin but in its comprehensiveness as well as its acute accounts of Benjamin&#x2019;s thought across the whole range of that thinking, it will continue to provide the foundation for the fuller understanding of his place and contribution to the critical, cultural, political and historical present we have inherited from the twentieth century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Ferris</b><b>, </b><b><i>Critical Inquiry</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Walter Benjamin deserves to be more celebrated, and <i>Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life</i>, by Howard Eiland and Michael Jennings, is a step in the right direction.

It is also a deeply poignant story of his struggle to survive in a hostile Europe and his tragic suicide at the age of 48.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cyril Kavanaugh</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Presented here in what looks like a definitive version, Benjamin&#x2019;s life emerges as a tragedy of incompleteness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Gray</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b></p><h2>Forest Giants of the Pacific Coast</h2><p>A U. of Washington and Evergreen State College forest ecologist who started the Washington State Big Tree Program explains how trees are measured to qualify for the program, then covers paragons of 20 species of conifers from the General Sherman giant sequoia to the king Engelmann spruce.

It is an entertaining survey of 80 plant genera, with a multitude of references to, and extracts from, myth and literature from Shakespeare to the Victorian language of flowers.

Collected in this fat, satisfying volume are quotations from poetry, plays, and stories written by the ancient Greeks up through the Victorians that trace the rich history of the natural world as captured in myth and literature. Symbolism, traditional medicinal uses, and most of all lyrical tributes to favorite plants from acanthus to zinnia fill the pages of this book, to be read for sheer pleasure or dipped into for information about specific flowers. The book is easy to use compared to many such compilations, in part because it is arranged by type of plant, and because Ward has masterfully woven it all together with a blend of historical and botanical commentary for context.</p><p> You won't learn from this book how to plant a bulb or grow a tomato, but there are more than enough books on the practical matters of gardening. Rather, folk tales, myths, legends, and lore of the flowers, in the words of sages, saints, herbalists, and poets provide inspiration, humor, and fine reading. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>An entertaining survey of 80 classic garden plants, with a multitude of references to, &amp; extracts from, myth &amp; literature from the earliest times to the recent past.

Behavior Management and Classroom Management or Applied Behavior Analysis. Behavior Management: Applications for Teachers provides a comprehensive overview of behavior management and classroom management to include introduction, definitions, assessment (functional and formal), strategies and applications. The focus of the strategies presented in this text is positive behavioral support and the prevention of challenging behavior within the classroom setting. Special attention is paid to special populations, such as young children, teens, and students from diverse backgrounds. The text is packed with classroom connection vignettes, follow-up discussion questions per classroom connection, practical applications and examples so that the content is clear to the reader and easily applied to the classroom.</p><p>Preface <p> Behavior Management: Applications for Teachers, Third Edition, continues to provide readers with both technical and functional understanding of applied behavior analysis, as well as a discussion of the everyday applications of behavior management in classrooms and other educational settings. We try to communicate this information in language that is understandable to professionals and paraprofessionals. As with the second edition, readers will observe several major differences with this text compared to other behavior management or applied behavior management texts. These differences are based on our own values regarding the management of behavior and the recognition of current trends in society. </p><p> Some readers might be surprised to find a chapter devoted to formal or standardized behavioral assessment (Chapter 2). However, because more than 250 million standardized tests are administered each year to American schoolchildren&#x2014;many as a result of perceived "behavioral problems"&#x2014;we want to be sure that our readers understand the purpose of formal/ standardized behavioral assessments, when and how they should be employed, and their limitations. Examples of many behavioral assessment tools are provided in Chapter 2. </p><p> A new chapter to this third edition, Chapter 3, discusses the techniques and issues of functional assessment-now required by many school districts and considered by many as more important and useful for teachers than standardized behavioral assessment. </p><p> Cognitive behavior management and social skills training, while significant methods in the behavioral management literature, have been largely ignored in current behavior management texts. In view of this, Chapters 6 and 7 include information that will help fill that void for readers who would like to gain an understanding of behavior management beyond the traditional methods of applied behavior analysis. In addition, these chapters reinforce our belief that the best behavior management strategy is the teaching and reinforcement of appropriate, prosocial behaviors. </p><p> Another new chapter to this third edition is Chapter 10, which discusses legal considerations. With changes in the law and many court rulings regarding discipline in schools, this important chapter provides up-to-date information to educators regarding the legal issues and behavior management in the schools. </p><p> We recognize the growing preschool field and the expansion of day care and other services provided for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Although the basic principles of behavior management apply for all children, preschool teachers and day-care workers must understand that infants and young children have unique characteristics that demand special consideration. The growing number of early childhood programs require that we address this population directly, and so we acknowledge the issues of early childhood behavior in Chapter 11. </p><p> Adolescent issues are also a significant and growing concern to many educators. The number of adolescents referred to out-of-home treatment facilities is at an all-time high. Clearly, this population requires special attention in the field of behavior management, and we address these special issues directly in Chapter 12. </p><p> A person's behavior is influenced by his or her ethnic background, culture, and family customs. In Chapter 13 we urge all educators to learn about and become sensitive to the cultural influences on children's behavior. The danger of stereotyping is always possible while writing about these multicultural issues. We have tried to avoid this trap, recognizing the uniqueness of all individuals, while at the same time acknowledging the influence of traditions and customs of those who share a common ethnic and cultural background. </p><p> Finally, we recognize that the best and most effective behavior management strategy is the teaching and reinforcement of appropriate behaviors and social skills. This belief is integrated throughout the text. </p><p> This text includes the basic mechanics of applied behavior analysis (Chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8). In many areas, the text breaks from the traditional applied behavior analysis texts and includes current topics and issues in behavior management (Chapters 2, 6, 7, 9,10,11,12, &amp; 13). We hope our readers will find these additional chapters useful and informative. We also hope that our readers will share their thoughts with us on how this third edition may be improved. We welcome and look forward to your comments. AUDIENCE </p><p> This text is designed for use in both undergraduate and graduate behavior management, classroom management, or applied behavior management courses. The text is appropriate for the preservice and in-service training of regular and special educators; preschool, elementary, and secondary educators; educational administrators; counselors; psychologists; and social workers.

As a teacher or administrator, how should you respond? This type of issue is one most educators will have to confront eventually, in addition to other hot-button issues such as zero-tolerance policies, drug and alcohol testing, and prayer in schools. The School Law Handbook is designed to enable educators to confront such issues with information, insight, and initiative. The issues are organized into five areas: the school environment, Constitutional issues, students, personnel, and accountability. Within each area are several chapters, each beginning with a realistic scenario followed by legal and practical analyses of the situation. Armed with this knowledge of the parameters governing each scenario, educators can more effectively manage their responses, asking and answering the key questions: - What are the legal boundaries? - What is the district policy related to this issue? - What are the potential strategies for resolution? In this era of unparalleled public scrutiny, The School Law Handbook is essential reading for all school personnel.</p><p></p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of Social and Political Thought: Essential Readings: Ancient, Modern, and Contemporary Texts</h2><p><p> This volume features a careful selection of major works in political and social philosophy from ancient times through to the present.

The focus this time is on graph algorithms, which are increasingly critical for a wide range of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, scheduling, transaction processing, and resource allocation. In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice with concise implementations that can be tested on real applications, which has made his work popular with programmers for many years. </p> <p> <b> <i>Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms</i> </b> is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, <i>Parts 1-4</i>, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. A focus on abstract data types makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment. </p> <p>Coverage includes: </p> <ul> <li>A complete overview of graph properties and types </li><li>Diagraphs and DAGs </li><li>Minimum spanning trees </li><li>Shortest paths </li><li>Network flows </li><li>Diagrams, sample C code, and detailed algorithm descriptions </li> </ul> <p>The Web site for this book (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) provides additional source code for programmers along with numerous support materials for educators. </p> <p>A landmark revision, <i> <b>Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5</b> </i> provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications. </p></p><p><p> </p><p> <b>Robert Sedgewick</b> is the William O.

This book describes the most important known methods for solving the graph-processing problems that arise in practice. Its primary aim is to make these methods and the basic principles behind them accessible to the growing number of people in need of knowing them. The material is developed from first principles, starting with basic information and working through classical methods up through modern techniques that are still under development. Carefully chosen examples, detailed figures, and complete implementations supplement thorough descriptions of algorithms and applications. </p> <p><b>Algorithms</b></p> <p> This book is the second of three volumes that are intended to survey the most important computer algorithms in use today. The first volume (Parts 1-4) covers fundamental concepts (Part 1), data structures (Part 2), sorting algorithms (Part 3), and searching algorithms (Part 4); this volume (Part 5) covers graphs and graph algorithms; and the (yet to be published) third volume (Parts 6-8) covers strings (Part 6), computational geometry (Part 7), and advanced algorithms and applications (Part 8). </p> <p> The books are useful as texts early in the computer science curriculum, after students have acquired basic programming skills and familiarity with computer systems, but before they have taken specialized courses in advanced areas of computer science or computer applications. The books also are useful for self-study or as a reference for people engaged in the development of computer systems or applications programs because they contain implementations of useful algorithms and detailed information on these algorithms' performance characteristics. The broad perspective taken makes the series an appropriate introduction to the field. </p> <p> Together the three volumes comprise the <i>Third Edition</i> of a book that has been widely used by students and programmers around the world for many years. I have completely rewritten the text for this edition, and I have added thousands of new exercises, hundreds of new figures, dozens of new programs, and detailed commentary on all the figures and programs. This new material provides both coverage of new topics and fuller explanations of many of the classic algorithms. A new emphasis on abstract data types throughout the books makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant in modern object-oriented programming environments. People who have read previous editions will find a wealth of new information throughout; all readers will find a wealth of pedagogical material that provides effective access to essential concepts. </p> <p> These books are not just for programmers and computer-science students. Nearly everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms that we consider represent a body of knowledge developed during the last 50 years that has become indispensable in the efficient use of the computer for a broad variety of applications. From N-body simulation problems in physics to genetic-sequencing problems in molecular biology, the basic methods described here have become essential in scientific research; and from database systems to Internet search engines, they have become essential parts of modern software systems. As the scope of computer applications becomes more widespread, so grows the impact of basic algorithms, particularly the fundamental graph algorithms covered in this volume. The goal of this book is to serve as a resource so that students and professionals can know and make intelligent use of graph algorithms as the need arises in whatever computer application they might undertake. </p> <p><b>Scope </b></p> <p> This book, <i>Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms,</i> contains six chapters that cover graph properties and types, graph search, directed graphs, minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, and networks. The descriptions here are intended to give readers an understanding of the basic properties of as broad a range of fundamental graph algorithms as possible. </p> <p> You will most appreciate the material here if you have had a course covering basic principles of algorithm design and analysis and programming experience in a high-level language such as C, Java, or C++. <i>Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Parts 1-4</i> is certainly adequate preparation. This volume assumes basic knowledge about arrays, linked lists, and ADT design, and makes uses of priority-queue, symbol-table, and union-find ADTs--all of which are described in de-tail in Parts 1-4 (and in many other introductory texts on algorithms and data structures). </p> <p> Basic properties of graphs and graph algorithms are developed from first principles, but full understanding of the properties of the algorithms can lead to deep and difficult mathematics. Although the discussion of advanced mathematical concepts is brief, general, and descriptive, you certainly need a higher level of mathematical maturity to appreciate graph algorithms than you do for the topics in Parts 1-4. Still, readers at various levels of mathematical maturity will be able to profit from this book. The topic dictates this approach: some elementary graph algorithms that should be understood and used by everyone differ only slightly from some advanced algorithms that are not understood by anyone. The primary intent here is to place important algorithms in context with other methods throughout the book, not to teach all of the mathematical material. But the rigorous treatment demanded by good mathematics often leads us to good programs, so I have tried to provide a balance between the formal treatment favored by theoreticians and the coverage needed by practitioners, without sacrificing rigor. </p> <p><b>Use in the Curriculum </b></p> <p> There is a great deal of flexibility in how the material here can be taught, depending on the taste of the instructor and the preparation of the students. The algorithms described have found widespread use for years, and represent an essential body of knowledge for both the practicing programmer and the computer science student. There is sufficient coverage of basic material for the book to be used in a course on data structures and algorithms, and there is sufficient detail and coverage of advanced material for the book to be used for a course on graph algorithms. Some instructors may wish to emphasize implementations and practical concerns; others may wish to emphasize analysis and theoretical concepts. </p> <p> For a more comprehensive course, this book is also available in a special bundle with Parts 1-4; thereby instructors can cover fundamentals, data structures, sorting, searching, and graph algorithms in one consistent style. A complete set of slide masters for use in lectures, sample programming assignments, interactive exercises for students, and other course materials may be found by accessing the book's home page. </p> <p> The exercises--nearly all of which are new to this edition--fall into several types. Some are intended to test understanding of material in the text, and simply ask readers to work through an example or to apply concepts described in the text. Others involve implementing and putting together the algorithms, or running empirical studies to compare variants of the algorithms and to learn their properties. Still other exercises are a repository for important information at a level of detail that is not appropriate for the text. Reading and thinking about the exercises will pay dividends for every reader. </p> <p><b>Algorithms of Practical Use </b></p> <p> Anyone wanting to use a computer more effectively can use this book for reference or for self-study. People with programming experience can find information on specific topics throughout the book. To a large extent, you can read the individual chapters in the book independently of the others, although, in some cases, algorithms in one chapter make use of methods from a previous chapter. </p> <p> The orientation of the book is to study algorithms likely to be of practical use. The book provides information about the tools of the trade to the point that readers can confidently implement, debug, and put to work algorithms to solve a problem or to provide functionality in an application. Full implementations of the methods discussed are included, as are descriptions of the operations of these programs on a consistent set of examples. Because we work with real code, rather than write pseudo-code, the programs can be put to practical use quickly. Program listings are available from the book's home page. Indeed, one practical application of the algorithms has been to produce the hundreds of figures throughout the book. Many algorithms are brought to light on an intuitive level through the visual dimension provided by these figures. </p> <p> Characteristics of the algorithms and of the situations in which they might be useful are discussed in detail. Although not emphasized, connections to the analysis of algorithms and theoretical computer science are developed in context. When appropriate, empirical and analytic results are presented to illustrate why certain algorithms are preferred. When interesting, the relationship of the practical algorithms being discussed to purely theoretical results is described. Specific information on performance characteristics of algorithms and implementations is synthesized, encapsulated, and discussed throughout the book. </p> <p><b>Programming Language </b></p> <p> The programming language used for all of the implementations is C (versions of the book in C++ and Java are under development). Any particular language has advantages and disadvantages; we use C in this book because it is widely available and provides the features needed for the implementations here. The programs can be translated easily to other modern programming languages because relatively few constructs are unique to C. We use standard C idioms when appropriate, but this book is not intended to be a reference work on C programming. </p> <p> We strive for elegant, compact, and portable implementations, but we take the point of view that efficiency matters, so we try to be aware of the code's performance characteristics at all stages of development. There are many new programs in this edition, and many of the old ones have been reworked, primarily to make them more readily useful as abstract-data-type implementations. Extensive comparative empirical tests on the programs are discussed throughout the book. </p> <p> A goal of this book is to present the algorithms in as simple and direct a form as possible. The style is consistent whenever possible so that similar programs look similar. For many of the algorithms, the similarities remain regardless of which language is used: Dijkstra's algorithm (to pick one prominent example) is Dijkstra's algorithm, whether expressed in Algol-60, Basic, Fortran, Smalltalk, Ada, Pascal, C, C++, Modula-3, PostScript, Java, or any of the countless other programming languages and environments in which it has proved to be an effective graph-processing method. </p> <br> <br> 0201316633P09182001</p><h2>Mustang II 1974 to 1978: Mustang II / Hardtop / 2 + 2 / Mach 1 (Chilton's Repair &amp; Tune-Up Guide)</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

Convinced that he is being hunted by the Inquisition, he joins a band of wanderers - including a gypsy chief, a geometer, a cabbalist and the Wandering Jew himself - who travel aimlessly while regaling their companions with a hundred and more stories, and stories within stories, told over the course of sixty-six 'days', each day as disorienting as a thousand and one nights.<br>And this nest of stories frames yet more stories driving the reader ever deeper into a labyrinth of sadism, satanism, the cabbala and other phantoms brought forth by the sleep of eighteenth-century Reason.

Olson's theories, which made explicit the principles of his own poetics and those of the Black Mountain poets, were instrumental in defining the sense of the postmodern in poetry and form the basis of most postwar free verse.<br><br>The <i>Collected Prose</i> brings together in one volume the works published for the most part between 1946 and 1969, many of which are now out of print. A valuable companion to editions of Olson's poetry, the book backgrounds the poetics, preoccupations, and fascinations that underpin his great poems. Included are <i>Call Me Ishmael</i>, a classic of American literary criticism; the influential essays "Projective Verse" and "Human Universe"; and essays, book reviews, and Olson's notes on his studies. In these pieces one can trace the development of his new science of man, called "muthologos," a radical mix of myth and phenomenology that Olson offered in opposition to the mechanistic discourse and rationalizing policy he associated with America's recent wars in Europe and Asia.<br><br>Editors Donald Allen and Benjamin Friedlander offer helpful annotations throughout, and poet Robert Creeley, who enjoyed a long and mutually influential relationship with Olson, provides the book's introduction.</p><p>"<i>Collected Prose</i> will introduce a new generation of readers to a central modernist and postmodernist thinker in American letters.

By 1851, this early photographic method had been improved by American daguerreotypists to such a degree that it was often referred to as &#x201c;the American process.&#x201d; The daguerreotype&#x2015;now perhaps mostly associated with stiffly posed portraits of serious-visaged nineteenth-century personages&#x2015;was an extremely detailed photographic image, produced though a complicated process involving a copper plate, light-sensitive chemicals, and mercury fumes. It was, as Sarah Kate Gillespie shows in this generously illustrated history, something wholly and remarkably new: a product of science and innovative technology that resulted in a visual object. It was a hybrid, with roots in both fine art and science, and it interacted in reciprocally formative ways with fine art, science, and technology.</p><p>Gillespie maps the evolution of the daguerreotype, as medium and as profession, from its introduction to the ascendancy of the &#x201c;American process,&#x201d; tracing its relationship to other fields and the professionalization of those fields. She does so by recounting the activities of a series of American daguerreotypists, including fine artists, scientists, and mechanical tinkerers. She describes, for example, experiments undertaken by Samuel F. B. Morse as he made the transition from artist to inventor; how artists made use of the daguerreotype, both borrowing conventions from fine art and establishing new ones for a new medium; the use of the daguerreotype in various sciences, particularly astronomy; and technological innovators who drew on their work in the mechanical arts. </p><p>By the 1860s, the daguerreotype had been supplanted by newer technologies. Its rise (and fall) represents an early instance of the ever-constant stream of emerging visual technologies.</p></p><p>Sarah Kate Gillespie is Curator of American Art at the Georgia Museum of Art, located at the University of Georgia.<p>Gillespie offers a sophisticated and lively treatment of the daguerreotype's first decade on the American strand. She deftly assesses the contributions to the process of such key early promoters and practitioners as Samuel F. B. Morse, John William Draper, and Robert Cornelius, and through them and others explores the complex intersection of the daguerreotype with art, science, and technology. She convincingly argues that the nascent photographic process contributed greatly to the definition or redefinition of each of these fields. Beautifully illustrated and elegantly written, it is a signal contribution to the field of American culture studies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Philip F. Gura</b>, William S. Newman Distinguished Professor of American Literature and Culture, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br><br><p>This probing book excavates the history of the daguerreotype's first decade, when the medium's revolutionary promise, democratizing potential, and broad range of applications were tempered only by skepticism of its aesthetic qualities and trepidation regarding its mystical powers. Gillespie reveals how overlapping discourses of art, science, and technology shaped perceptions of the daguerreotype, illuminating the medium's complex polygenesis while conveying America's embrace of the technology as a sign of its providentially ordained progress.</p>&#x2015;<b>Peter John Brownlee</b>, Curator, Terra Foundation for American Art; editor of <i>Samuel F.

The course covers principally the theory and physical applications of linear algebra and of the calculus of several variables, particularly the exterior calculus. The authors adopt the &#39;spiral method&#39; of teaching, covering the same topic several times at increasing levels of sophistication and range of application. Thus the reader develops a deep, intuitive understanding of the subject as a whole, and an appreciation of the natural progression of ideas. Topics covered include many items previously dealt with at a much more advanced level, such as algebraic topology (introduced via the analysis of electrical networks), exterior calculus, Lie derivatives, and star operators (which are applied to Maxwell&#39;s equations and optics). This then is a text which breaks new ground in presenting and applying sophisticated mathematics in an elementary setting. Any student, interpreted in the widest sense, with an interest in physics and mathematics, will gain from its study.</p><p>This textbook covers the theory and physical applications of linear algebra and of the calculus of several variables, particularly the exterior calculus.

In this case the region constitutes approximately one-fifth of the land area of the conterminous United States. Flora of the Great Plains is the culmination of a monumental undertaking, begun some thirty-five years ago and founded on a massive specimen collection program. The Great Plains Flora Association itself was formed to combined the resources of fourteen botanists and their herbaria at various institutions in the region and to compile the flora. <p><i>Flora of the Great Plains</i> is a manual of the vascular plants that occur spontaneously in the region that extends from the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountain uplift, eastward to the potential beginning of continuous woodland, and from the Canadian border south through the Texas Panhandle. Thus included are the states of Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota; eastern Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado; northeast New Mexico; the Texas Panhandle; northwest Oklahoma; and western Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota. This volume is the only up-to-date floristic treatment in existence for the area. </p><p><i>Flora of the Great Plains</i> includes general keys, descriptions, statements of range, flowering times, ecological data, and relevant synonymies for every flowering plant, conifer, and fern known to occur in the region.

Bringing the abuses to the attention of newspapers and magazines across the country, they led a reform effort to change public attitudes and to improve the training and status of institutional staff. Prominent Americans, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, ACLU founder Roger Baldwin, author Pearl S. Buck, actress Helen Hayes, and African-American activist Mary McLeod Bethune, supported the efforts of the young men.<br><br>These young men were among the 12,000 World War II conscientious objectors who chose to perform civilian public service as an alternative to fighting in what is widely regarded as America&#x2019;s &#x201c;good war.&#x201d; Three thousand of these men volunteered to work at state institutions where they discovered appalling conditions. Acting on conscience a second time, they challenged America&#x2019;s treatment of its citizens with severe disabilities. Acts of Conscience brings to light the extra-ordinary efforts of these courageous men, drawing upon extensive archival research, interviews, and personal correspondence. <br><br>The World War II conscientious objectors were not the first to expose public institutions, and they would not be the last. What distinguishes them from reformers of other eras is that their activities have faded from the professional and popular memory.

Taylor&#x2019;s curiosity and his outrage have yielded a lucid, compelling, and eminently readable historical narrative . . . . Acts of Conscience clearly establishes conscientious objectors as credible witnesses and actors of extraordinary courage and purposefulness.

Its selections not only situate technology in the familiar context of ethical, political, aesthetic, and engineering concerns, but also thoroughly examine historical, metaphysical, and epistemological issues. The volume begins with historical readings on knowledge and its applications that have laid the foundation for contemporary writings on the philosophy of technology. Contemporary essays then critically assess previous assumptions about science and discuss the relation between science and technology and philosophy&#39;s treatment of both. The second half of the volume focuses on Heidegger&#39;s writings on technology, on the relationship between technology and the natural world, and on the issues that arise as technology becomes an integral part of our society.Philosophy of Technology includes, beyond the commonly anthologized figures, selections from European writers often not available in English-language collections.

But for sheer cantankerousness, fighting moxie, and will to win, very few have come close to Leo &#x201c;the Lip&#x201d; Durocher. Following a five-decade career as a player and manager for baseball&#x2019;s most storied franchises, Durocher teamed up with veteran sportswriter Ed Linn to tell the story of his life in the game. The resulting book, <i>Nice Guys Finish Last</i>, is baseball at its best, brimming with personality and full of all the fights and feuds, triumphs and tricks that made Durocher such a success&#x2014;and an outsized celebrity.<br> <br> Durocher began his career inauspiciously, riding the bench for the powerhouse 1928 Yankees and hitting so poorly that Babe Ruth nicknamed him &#x201c;the All-American Out.&#x201d; But soon Durocher hit his stride: traded to St. Louis, he found his headlong play and never-say-die attitude a perfect fit with the rambunctious &#x201c;Gashouse Gang&#x201d; Cardinals. In 1939, he was named player-manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x2014;and almost instantly transformed the underachieving Bums into perennial contenders. He went on to manage the New York Giants, sharing the glory of one of the most famous moments in baseball history, Bobby Thomson&#x2019;s &#x201c;shot heard &#x2019;round the world,&#x201d; which won the Giants the 1951 pennant. Durocher would later learn how it felt to be on the other side of such an unforgettable moment, as his 1969 Cubs, after holding first place for 105 days, blew a seemingly insurmountable 8-1/2-game lead to the Miracle Mets.<br> <br> All the while, Durocher made as much noise off the field as on it. His perpetual feuds with players, owners, and league officials&#x2014;not to mention his public associations with gamblers, riffraff, and Hollywood stars like George Raft and Larraine Day&#x2014;kept his name in the headlines and spread his fame far beyond the confines of the diamond.<br> <br> A no-holds-barred account of a singular figure, <i>Nice Guys Finish Last</i> brings the personalities and play-by-play of baseball&#x2019;s greatest era to vivid life, earning a place on every baseball fan&#x2019;s bookshelf.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Ed Linn</b> (1922&#x2013;2000),&nbsp;&nbsp;a well respected sports-writer, was the author of 17 books, including <i>Hitter: The Life and Turmoils of Ted Williams</i>, <i>Nice Guys Finish Last</i>, and <i>Where the Money Is</i>.<p>&nbsp;&#x201c;The delight of the book is its exuberance, its sense of a life lived at full tilt. . . .

In 1921, some 10,000 West Virginia coal miners, outraged over years of brutality and lawless exploitation, picked up their Winchesters and marched against their tormentors, the powerful mine owners who ruled their corrupt state. For ten days the miners fought a pitched battle against an opposing legion of deputies, state police, and makeshift militia. Only the intervention of a federal expeditionary force, spearheaded by a bomber squadron commanded by General Billy Mitchell, ended this undeclared civil war and forced the miners to throw down their arms. The significance of this episode reaches beyond the annals of labor history. Indeed, it is a saga of the conflicting political, economic and cultural forces that shaped the power structure of 20th century America.</p><p><b>Robert Shogan</b> has spent more than thirty years covering the political scene in Washington as national political correspondent for <i>Newsweek</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> . He is currently Adjunct Professor of Government at the Center for Study of American Government of Johns Hopkins University. He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.In this concise, dramatic and authoritative account of the bloody 1921 encounter between the mine workers and mine owners of the West Virginia coalfields&#x2014;the most tumultuous labor battle in American history&#x2014;Shogan gives us a strikingly vivid post-WWI America both utterly foreign and oddly familiar. A former political reporter for <i>Newsweek </i>and the Los Angeles <i>Times, </i>Shogan is as much good feature writer as historian. Out of a confusing and often still-disputed series of events, he sets scenes and fills in necessary background with an unfussy narrative drive. Such well-known figures as the mercurial Mother Jones and the stalwart Samuel Gompers have their roles, as do a pair of presidents (Wilson and Harding), whose dithering made a difficult situation worse. Less familiar figures such as the organizer Sid Hatfield and the detective C.E. Lively are drawn with lifelike strokes. Police raids and deportations, bombs sent through the mail and a general air of panic and "red" hysteria build as miners and owners move inexorably toward their ultimate confrontation. The tragic outcome of the battle between a group of mountain people and the full power of the emerging superstate&#x2014;with WWI hero (and later state senator) Billy Mitchell's biplanes ready, 15 years before Guernica, to bomb civilians&#x2014;is inevitable, but it is Shogan's triumph here to make the reader feel it anew. A minor quibble is the otherwise fine bibliography's failure to mention John Sayles's <i>Matewan, </i>surely an important (and reasonably accurate) version of the events in question. 10 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its originality shocked contemporary readers on its publication in 1916 who found its treating of the minutiae of daily life as indecorous, and its central character unappealing. Was it art or was it filth?<br>The novel charts the intellectual, moral, and sexual development of Stephen Dedalus, from his childhood listening to his father's stories through his schooldays and adolescence to the brink of adulthood and independence, and his awakening as an artist. Growing up in a Catholic family in Dublin in the final years of the nineteenth century, Stephen's consciousness is forged by Irish history and politics, by Catholicism and culture, language and art. Stephen's story mirrors that of Joyce himself, and the novel is both startlingly realistic and brilliantly crafted, not to mention that it is one of the founding texts of Modernism and the precursor of the acclaimed <em>Ulysses.</em><br> For this edition Jeri Johnson, an eminent Joyce scholar, has written an introduction and notes which together provide a comprehensive and illuminating appreciation of Joyce's artistry.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesPerhaps Joyce&#39;s most personal work, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man depicts the intellectual awakening of one of literature&#39;s most memorable young heroes, Stephen Dedalus. Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>The Art of Painting Flowers in Oil &amp; Acrylic: Discover simple step-by-step techniques for painting an array of flowers and plants (Collector's Series)</h2><p><p><b>Learn everything you need to know to create beautiful floral works of art in oil and acrylic!</b></p><p>This comprehensive book opens with a guide to essential information on the necessary tools and materials for both sketching and painting, including pencils, paints and brushes, palettes, supports, and mediums.

He died in 1965 virtually unrecognized, yet in the following years his work and thought have attracted and intrigued an international audience. Now this comprehensive biography gives a pivotal poet his due. Based on interviews with scores of Spicer&#39;s contemporaries, Poet Be Like God details the most intimate aspects of Spicer&#39;s life-his family, his friends, his lovers-illuminating not only the man but also many of his poems. Such illumination extends also to the works of others whom Spicer came to know, including the writers Frank O&#39;Hara, Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Helen Adam, Robin Blaser, Charles Olson, Philip K. Dick, Richard Brautigan, and Marianne Moore and the painters Jess, Fran Herndon, and Jay DeFeo. The resulting narrative, an engaging chronicle of the San Francisco Renaissance and the emergence of the North Beach gay scene during the 50s and 60s, will be indispensable reading for students of American literature and gay studies.</p><p>From the time it first emerged as a renegade liberating voice in the early 1950s, beat writing changed the American social literary scene. Poets like Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti altered the sound of U.S. poetry while Jack Kerouac's bebop chant--particularly in his classic <i>On the Road</i>--literally changed how Americans spoke. The beats' fame became so great so quickly that their critics accused them of hypocrisy. Not so Jack Spicer; while Ginsberg and Kerouac were busy publishing and promoting their work, Spicer--whose original lyric voice and gay content still resonate today--spent most of his time disdaining the publishing world and making enemies. In <i>Poet Be Like God</i>, journalist Lewis Ellingham and experimental novelist Kevin Killian have produced not only a fully realized portrait of Spicer, but a complexly woven historical and literary tapestry. Spicer emerges here as a brilliant, difficult, and largely unlikable man whose talent for writing matched his inability to function in the world. Ellingham and Killian are equally concerned with explicating the San Francisco renaissance and charting the emergence of North Beach as a gay neighborhood; <i>Poet Be Like God</i> thus rediscovers Jack Spicer for a new generation of readers and presents us with a unique and startling look at gay and literary history. <i>--Michael Bronski</i>6 x 9 trim. 30 illus.

Neuman offers an account of North Indian Hindustani music culture and the changing social context of which it is part, as expressed in the thoughts and actions of its professional musicians.<br> <br> Drawing primarily from fieldwork performed in Delhi in 1969-71&#x2014;from interviewing musicians, learning and performing on the Indian fiddle, and speaking with music connoisseurs&#x2014;Neuman examines the cultural and social matrix in which Hindustani music is nurtured, listened and attended to, cultivated, and consumed in contemporary India. Through his interpretation of the impact that modern media, educational institutions, and public performances exert on the music and musicians, Neuman highlights the drama of a great musical tradition engaging a changing world, and presents the adaptive strategies its practitioners employ to practice their art. His work has gained the distinction of introducing a new approach to research on Indian music, and appears in this edition with a new preface by the author.<br></p></p><p>Daniel M. Neuman offers an account of North Indian Hindustani music culture and the changing social context of which it is part, as expressed in the thoughts and actions of its professional musicians.</p><h2>On Poetry</h2><p><p>"This is a book for anyone," Glyn Maxwell declares of <i>On Poetry</i>. A guide to the writing of poetry and a defense of the art, it will be especially prized by writers and readers who wish to understand why and how poetic technique matters. When Maxwell states, "With rhyme what matters is the distance between rhymes" or "the line-break <i>is</i> punctuation," he compresses into simple, memorable phrases a great deal of practical wisdom.</p><p>In seven chapters whose weird, gnomic titles announce the singularity of the book--"White," "Black," "Form," "Pulse," "Chime," "Space," and "Time"--the poet explores his belief that the greatest verse arises from a harmony of mind and body, and that poetic forms originate in human necessities: breath, heartbeat, footstep, posture. "The sound of form in poetry descended from song, molded by breath, is the sound of that creature yearning to leave a mark. The meter says <i>tick-tock</i>. The rhyme says <i>remember</i>. The whiteness says <i>alone</i>," Maxwell writes. To illustrate his argument, he draws upon personal touchstones such as Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost. An experienced teacher, Maxwell also takes us inside the world of the creative writing class, where we learn from the experiences of four aspiring poets.</p><p>"You master form you master time," Maxwell says. In this guide to the most ancient and sublime of the realms of literature, Maxwell shares his mastery with us.</p></p><p>Long regarded as one of Britain&#x2019;s major poets, Glyn Maxwell is the author of numerous books, including <i>One Thousand Nights and Counting: Selected Poems</i> (2011).Defiantly and exhilaratingly poetic... I like the urgency and stringency of Maxwell&#x2019;s advice, and it should be useful to students coming to a poem, providing a set of keys to allow them entry... If the book is witty, and occasionally glib, it&#x2019;s also profound... Arguing with this book is part of the joy of it: it&#x2019;s provocative and opinionated and personal and urgent; by turns good-humored and intemperate; and full of earned advice on the writing and reading of poems. (Nick Laird <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2013-12-19)<br><br>Glyn Maxwell&#x2019;s effusive little book <i>On Poetry</i> is one of the best guides I have ever read to the greatest and most intimidating of all the literary forms. Maxwell is himself a poet and he wears his expertise confidently but casually. He takes on daunting, recondite concepts and elucidates them stylishly and personably, in the same spirit by which Roger Fry demystified the Post-Impressionists and Julia Child universalized the Quiche Lorraine... <i>On Poetry</i>...navigates a welcoming middle path between hidebound tradition and the free-for-all of formlessness. It reminds us that although only a select few are called to be Poets, reading, writing, and loving poetry is for anyone. (Sam Sacks <i>Open Letters Monthly</i> 2013-12-01)<br><br>Occasionally mad but very interesting. (Wendy Cope <i>The Observer</i> 2012-11-25)<br><br>[This] is a tremendously good book, and should be read by anyone who writes poetry and anyone who&#x2019;s interested in how and why poetry is written... It&#x2019;s a master class in close reading and close writing&#x2015;that is, in paying proper attention to the weight of words and their various shades of meanings, to their musical value and how one word affects its neighbor... This is the best book about poetry I&#x2019;ve ever read; certainly the only one that&#x2019;s made me laugh out loud. Maxwell&#x2019;s students are lucky to have him, and so are the rest of us. (Adam Newey <i>The Guardian</i> 2012-07-14)<br><br>A wee gem of a book, essential reading for anyone who reads or writes poetry. (Alan Spence <i>The Scotsman</i> 2012-12-08)<br><br>Poet Maxwell offers a refreshingly astringent, deeply personal, and forceful argument about what poetry is&#x2015;and is not... Maxwell&#x2019;s observations and exercises will be useful for all aspiring writers. An outstanding addition to the how, what, and why of poetry. (Michael Autrey <i>Booklist</i> 2013-09-20)<br><br>This wonderful new book by respected poet and dramatist Maxwell presents an inspiring how-to as well as a strong defense of poetry as a craft. The work reads as a prose poem in celebration of poetry... With an eye for how the poet brings life to words on a page, the author guides the reader through the importance of form and sound, thus teaching how a poem breathes. Each of the six chapters explicates a different poetic element...with a clarity of vision and delightful examples sure to engage poets, readers, and writers alike... Maxwell&#x2019;s intelligent, conversational approach is exhilarating in its openness and breathtaking in its insight into the art of writing poems; a highly recommended book for all readers, teachers, and students of poetry. (Herman Sutter <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2013-09-15)<br><br>A playful, challenging, provocative, and always surprising explication of the formal elements of poetry... [Maxwell] provides new ways of seeing the formal dimensions of poetry, whether canonical examples, his own works, or fresh-out-of-the-writing-workshop exercises... Required reading for anyone genuinely interested in contemporary poetry. (M. F. McClure <i>Choice</i> 2014-05-01)<br><br>The most compelling, original, charismatic and poetic guide to poetry that I can remember. A handbook written from the heart by one of the true modern masters of the craft. (Simon Armitage)<br><br>A wry, learned, immensely helpful running commentary on teaching young poets to write.

His enemy is man, but he especially hates Mowgli, the abandoned baby adopted by a kindly family of wolves, and swears to kill him. As the years pass, and Mowgli is brought up as a wolf-cub, the tiger&#39;s threats do not lessen. It is only through the protection of his friends-Baloo the bear, Kaa the python and Bagheera the black panther-that Mowgli survives, and begins to learn all there is to know about the Laws of the Jungle.<b>Rudyard Kipling</b> was born in Bombay in 1865. During his time at the United Services College, he began to write poetry, privately publishing <b>Schoolboy Lyrics</b> in 1881. The following year he started work as a journalist in India, and while there produced a body of work, stories, sketches, and poems including Mandalay, Gunga Din, and Danny Deeverwhich made him an instant literary celebrity when he returned to England in 1889. While living in Vermont with his wife, an American, Kipling wrote <b>The Jungle Books</b>, <b>Just So Stories</b>, and <b>Kim</b>which became widely regarded as his greatest long work, putting him high among the chronicles of British expansion. Kipling returned to England in 1902, but he continued to travel widely and write, though he never enjoyed the literary esteem of his early years.

Recent missions such as Voyager and Galileo required gravity assist maneuvers at several planets to accomplish their objectives. Today&#39;s students of aerospace engineering face the challenge of calculating these types of complex spacecraft trajectories. This classroom-tested textbook takes its title from an elective course which has been taught to senior undergraduates and first-year graduate students for the past 22 years. The subject of orbital mechanics is developed starting from the first principles, using Newton&#39;s laws of motion and the law of gravitation to prove Kepler&#39;s empirical laws of planetary motion. Unlike many texts the authors also use first principles to derive other important results including Kepler&#39;s equation, Lambert&#39;s time-of-flight equation, the rocket equation, the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of relative motion, Gauss&#39; equations for the variation of the elements, and the Gauss and Laplace methods of orbit determination. The subject of orbit transfer receives special attention. Optimal orbit transfers such as the Hohmann transfer, minimum-fuel transfers using more than two impulses, and non-coplanar orbital transfer are discussed. Patched-conic interplanetary trajectories including gravity-assist maneuvers are the subject of an entire chapter and are particularly relevant to modern space missions.</p><p><br>John A.

In addition, chapters are now presented in a lecture-friendly format, with headers summarizing each of the major concepts. As in earlier editions, basic principles of molecular, cellular, and integrative endocrinology are presented early, along with an updated guide to current research and methodologies. Following chapters contain discussions of each of the major endocrine systems, supplemented with the most important and interesting new information. Neuroendocrine and reproductive systems are the specialty of the new co-author of this edition, and corresponding chapters have been appropriately increased in coverage. Special features of this new edition include... 1. Expanded explanations of bas</p><p>Hadley provides an comprehensive coverage of endocrinology, centralizing on the critical roles of chemical messengers and hormones--whether they are of endocrine or neural origin--in the control of physiological processes. This up-t o-date Fourth Edition depicts, through demonstration, the entire human endocrine system in examples designed specifically for premedical and related professional courses. Hadley examines several recently discovered hormones--including their origin , biosynthesis, chemistry, secretion, circulation and metabolism, physiological roles, control of secretion, mechanisms of action and pathophysiology.Preface <p> The central theme of this text is the role of chemical messengers, or hormones, whether they are of endocrine or neural origin, in the control of physiological processes. Although endocrine physiology has been separated from neurophysiology in the past, it is now amply documented that hormones may originate from either endocrine or neural tissue. Thus has emerged the field of neuroendocrinology. Several eminent endocrinologists have been awarded Nobel Prizes in Physiology/Medicine for their monumental efforts leading to the discovery and elucidation of the chemical structure of several brain neuropeptides (neurohormones); this clearly emphasizes the importance of the concept of neuroendocrine physiology. It is now also realized that the so-called "classical" hormones are produced in many sites throughout the body and may be released directly into the blood, into neuronal synapses, or into the immediate intercellular space to affect adjacent cellular activity. This more inclusive definition of "hormone", therefore, has been employed, as suggested by Nobel laureate Roger Guillemin. The important point emphasized in this definition is that it is both the method of delivery as well as the source of the hormone that is of greatest physiological significance. </p> <p> In Introduction to Endocrinology, a short chronology of endocrine research is presented. The concept of homeostasis is then discussed with special reference given to the roles of chemical messengers in the control of homeostatic systems. The reader is then provided with a general description of The Vertebrate Endocrine System, wherein an initial working vocabulary is established. Included here is a discussion of the general classes of chemical messengers and other cellular regulators (steroid and peptide hormones, neurohormones, chalones, growth factors, eicosanoids, pheromones); the cellular synthesis of chemical messengers and their secretion, delivery, and metabolism; and a general overview of the physiological role of hormones. In consideration of the various methodologies used in present-day endocrine research, it was considered necessary to add a chapter on Endocrine Methodologies early in the text. Classical surgical and histological techniques are discussed, as are more recent methods including radioimmunoassay, radioreceptor assay, radioisotope enzyme assay, autoradiography, and recombinant-DNA methodologies. It was also considered important to provide, early in the book, a discussion of General Mechanisms of Hormone Action, because these concepts are a necessary component of each of the following chapters. Included within this chapter is a discussion of cellular receptors, cyclic nucleotides as second messengers, prostaglandins (and prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes), stimulus-response coupling, calmodulin (a cellular calcium receptor), and phosphorylated proteins as physiological effectors. </p> <p> The source, synthesis, chemistry, and general role of the Pituitary Hormones in the control of endocrine physiology are discussed next, because the pituitary gland is a major source of hormones regulating many other endocrine glands. More specific details of the roles and actions of these hormones are provided in subsequent chapters. Because the secretion of each of the pituitary hormones is controlled by hypophysiotropic hormones of hypothalamic origin, a chapter on the role of The Endocrine Hypothalamus is provided. The evidence supporting the neurovascular hypothesis is emphasized. </p> <p> Chapter 7, Neurohypophysial Hormones, provides a complete coverage of the source, synthesis, chemistry, secretion, metabolism, biological actions, and mechanisms of action of the posterior pituitary hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin. The evolution of hormone structure is emphasized under the comparative endocrinology of neurohypophysial hormones. Chapter 8, The Melanotropic Hormones, emphasizes the recent discovery that pro-opiomelanocortin is the precursor protein of amelanotropin, adrenocorticotropin, and human's own analgesic hormones, the endorphins (opiatelike peptides). The author has done considerable research in the field of melanotropins and vertebrate pigmentation, particularly in relationship to the control of melanocyte-stimulating hormone secretion and the mechanisms of action of the melanotropins. Because the secretion and actions of most all hormones involve the calcium ion, the roles of parathormone, calcitonin, and vitamin D in the Hormonal Control of Calcium Homeostasis are discussed early in the book (Chap. 9). </p> <p> The next six chapters are grouped together because they all relate to aspects of metabolic endocrinology. The Gastrointestinal Hormones play important roles in the control of foodstuff movement through the gastrointestinal tract and its transport through the intestinal mucosa and into the general circulation. The chapter on Pancreatic Hormones and Metabolic Endocrinology discusses the roles of the endocrine pancreas in the storage and utilization of metabolic substrates. The contrasting roles of insulin and glucagon are explored, as are the possible roles of the newer pancreatic hormones, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. In a chapter on Growth Hormones, the varied roles of the somatomedins and other peptide-growth hormones, such as nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, erythropoietin, and the thymic growth factors, as well as growth inhibitory factors (chalones) are discussed, in addition to an in-depth coverage of pituitary somatotropin (growth hormone). </p> <p> In the chapter on Thyroid Hormones, evidence is marshaled demonstrating that triiodothyronine is the physiologically relevant thyroid hormone at the cellular level. An up-to-date review of a model of thyroid hormone action is provided. A discussion of the integrated functional aspects of Catecholamines and the Sympathoadrenal System provides recent data on the developmental biology of catecholamine biosynthesis within adrenal chromaffin tissue and sympathetic neurons. The physiological roles of catecholamines as mediated through adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors) is discussed, and the pharmacology of the autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathoadrenal system, is reviewed. The chapter on the Adrenal Steroid Hormones completes the general discussion of the roles and actions of hormones in the control of metabolic homeostasis. Steroid hormone structure and nomenclature are reviewed. The roles of cortisol, a glucocorticoid, and aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, are discussed in detail. The pathophysiology of adrenocortical dysfunction provides an in-depth view of the etiological bases for endocrine pathophysiology. </p> <p> The next five chapters deal with the endocrinology of vertebrate reproductive systems, mostly mammalian systems. In the Endocrinology of Sex Differentiation and Development, the role of the Sry/SRY gene and its product, the testes-determining factor, in the regulation of gonadal differentiation is discussed. The early organizational roles of gonadal steroids in the development of neural centers (e.g., dimorphic nucleus) within the central nervous system, and the activation roles of steroids in CNS function in the adult animal are reviewed. In Hormones and Male Reproductive Physiology, as in Hormones and Female Reproductive Physiology, the origin, synthesis, chemistry, secretion, metabolism, biological roles, and mechanisms of actions of the male and female reproductive hormones are reviewed. A discussion of the pathophysiology of reproductive function in the human male and female provides an insight into the many genetic and congenital defects that affect normal growth and development of the human reproductive systems. In Endocrinology of Pregnancy, Parturition, and Lactation, the roles of hormones in the fertile period of the female are reviewed. Next is included a chapter on the Endocrine Role of the Pineal Gland, which reviews its putative role in reproductive physiology. This chapter is long overdue; the pineal gland is clearly an endocrine organ. </p> <p> A final chapter devoted to Neurohormones emphasizes the emerging understanding of the importance of neuropeptides to endocrine system function. For example, the discovery and physiological roles of the endorphins, the opiatelike peptides, or "analgesic hormones," are discussed. The role of other newly discovered brain peptides in the control of behavior, including cholecystokinin (or related peptide), is discussed. The recent discovery that certain gases (e.g., nitric oxide, carbon monoxide) are novel neurohormones is reviewed. The neuroendocrinology of extrinsic sensory perception is discussed, particularly as it provides similarities to hormone receptor transduction mechanisms. A general overview of neuroendocrine pathophysiology is provided to emphasize the molecular basis for the endocrinopathies in general. Lastly, the evolution of endocrine systems is discussed. </p> <p> Generally, each chapter is subdivided as follows: (1) Introduction (which provides a historical perspective to the particular topic), (2) Source, (3) Synthesis, (4) Chemistry, (5) Secretion, (6) Metabolism, (7) Physiological Roles, (8) Mechanism of Action, (9) Pathophysiology (of endocrine dysfunction), and (10) Comparative Endocrinology. Due to space limitations and other considerations the coverage of neuroendocrine physiology generally has been restricted to vertebrates, mainly mammals, particularly the human. Therefore, this book should be of special appeal to preprofessional students in medicine, dentistry, pharmacology, nutrition, nursing, and other related medical or animal sciences. Within each chapter, however, where appropriate, is included a short coverage of comparative endocrinology. </p> <p> Brand new to this fifth edition of Endocrinology is a set of review questions at the end of each chapter. Answers to these questions are to be found at the end of the book following the last chapter. The questions and answers were provided to the publisher, Prentice Hall, by a professor who has used the textbook for many years. Your input to the relevance of these questions/answers is desired. Submittal of questions that you might wish to be included in the next edition would be greatly appreciated. </p> <p> References are provided with each chapter, but, because space limitations place a premium on those selected, the most recently available are used. These references will provide the reader with most of the important earlier studies related to a particular topic. The author therefore acknowledges the unreferenced contributions of many investigators in the field of neuroendocrine physiology. </p> <p> Individuals interested in the topic of endocrinology mainly fall into the following general categories: (1) teachers and their students interested in a general (comprehensive) coverage of the topic, (2) teachers and their students with preprofessional interests (premedical, predental, other health-related sciences), (3) teachers and students interested in comparative endocrinology, and (4) professional scientists in research and health-related professions. Since time is limited and the coverage of endocrinology is extensive, some teachers of general or comparative endocrinology may desire to omit (not cover) the last section of each chapter dealing with Pathophysiology. </p> <p> The author appreciates the very informative figures that have been provided for this fifth edition by leading authorities in the field of endocrine physiology. I am particularly grateful to my past students, both in the classroom and the research laboratory, who provided me with an opportunity to develop the thoughts that are now presented in this textbook of endocrinology. The author is indebted to Ms. Danielle (Dani) Dubois for the superb effort she provided in helping formulate this much revised fifth edition. </p> <p> Helpful criticisms, corrections, or other comments are most welcome and may be addressed to the author. </p> <p> MAC E.

He starts hanging out at Al&#39;s Backyard, a local den selling booze and hamburgers to vagrant journalists who are mostly crazy drunks on the verge of quitting. Then he meets Yeamon, whose delectable girlfriend has Kemp stewing in his own lust. But the idle tension that builds up in places where men sweat twenty-four hours a day is reaching a violent breaking point.</p><p>"Disgusting as he usually was," Hunter Thompson writes in this, his 1959 novel, "on rare occasions he showed flashes of a stagnant intelligence. But his brain was so rotted with drink and dissolute living that whenever he put it to work it behaved like an old engine that had gone haywire from being dipped in lard." Surprise! Thompson isn't writing about himself, but one of the other, older, aimlessly carousing newspapermen in Puerto Rico, a guy called Moberg whose chief achievement is the ability to find his car after a night's drinking because it stinks so much. (I can smell it for blocks, he boasts.) The autobiographical hero, Paul Kemp, is 30, trapped in a dead-end job (Thompson wound up writing for a bowling magazine), and feeling as if his big-time writer dreams, soaked in Fitzgerald and Hemingway, are evaporating as rapidly as the rum in his fist.<p> In fact, Thompson was only 22 when he wrote <i>The Rum Diary</i>, but his fear of winding up like Moberg was well founded. What saved him was the fantastic conflagration of the 1960s, a fiery wind on which the reptilian wings of his prose style could catch and soar to the cackling heights of <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. Puerto Rico in 1959 doesn't have bad craziness enough to offer Thompson--just a routine drunken-reporter stomping by local cops and a riot over Kemp's friend's temptress girlfriend, a scantily imagined Smith College alumna who likes to strip nude on beaches and in nightclubs to taunt men.</p><p> Thompson's prose style only intermittently takes tentative flight--compare the stomping scenes in this book with his breakthrough, <i>Hell's Angels</i>--but it's interesting to see him so nakedly reveal his sensitive innards, before the celebrated clownish carapace grew in. It's also interesting to see how he improved this full version of the novel from the more raw (and racist) excerpts found in the 1990 collection <i>Songs of the Doomed</i> (available on audiocassette, partly narrated by Thompson). <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Hunter S.

Viewing twentieth-century history through the lens of language, author Liora Halperin questions the accepted scholarly narrative of a Zionist move away from multilingualism during the years following World War I, demonstrating how Jews in Palestine remained connected linguistically by both preference and necessity to a world outside the boundaries of the pro-Hebrew community even as it promoted Hebrew and achieved that language&#x2019;s dominance.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story of language encounters in Jewish Palestine is a fascinating tale of shifting power relationships, both locally and globally. Halperin&#x2019;s absorbing study explores how a young national community was compelled to modify the dictates of Hebrew exclusivity as it negotiated its relationships with its Jewish population, Palestinian Arabs, the British, and others outside the margins of the national project and ultimately came to terms with the limitations of its hegemony in an interconnected world.</p><p><b>Liora R.

She shares her knowledge in her popular workshops and now in this book. Cohen, who has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for eighteen years, was hobbling painfully to her local Zen center one day, when she made a discovery that changed her life: if she focused on the foot that was in the air rather than the one that was hitting the pavement, her stamina increased enormously. It was the beginning of a completely different approach to the crippling pain that had beset her for so long. As she demonstrates here, this approach can be expanded to all types of pain: physical, psychological, and spiritual. Cohen&#x2014;a certified massage and movement therapist and Zen teacher&#x2014;proposes a radically liberating alternative to the usual desperate search for pain relief: paradoxically, she says, release from suffering lies in paying closer attention to it. When we keep pain at bay, we keep pleasure at bay, too. The two are interdependent, and our ability to experience each is totally dependent on our understanding of the other. "Enrich your life exponentially," Cohen advises. If your pain is one of the ten things you are aware of, then it constitutes a tenth of your total awareness. Expand your awareness to a hundred things, however, and your pain is only a hundredth of your awareness. With stories, strategies, exercises, and an awareness born of long Zen practice, Cohen shows us how to tap into that enrichment&#x2014;and how we can lead a satisfying and even joyful life in the very midst of pain.</p><p>For the past 20 years author Darlene Cohen has had rheumatoid arthritis, a painful and crippling condition. "I became isolated from everyone I knew by my pain and fear and ultimately even by the consuming effort I had to make to do any little thing--like get up from a chair, fix a cup of tea," she writes. How do we live through catastrophic situations such as Cohen's without being destroyed? For starters, don't go numb, suggests Cohen, a Zen teacher who offers pain seminars in medical facilities and meditation centers along the West Coast. "If we don't acknowledge our pain, we usually don't feel our pleasure either," Cohen explains. "Life takes on a zombie-like tenor." In fact, many of our most self-destructive habits come from an avoidance of physical or emotional pain, claims Cohen, such as substance abuse, becoming overly scheduled or overly busy, avoiding intimacy to avoid hurt. Through storytelling, attitude adjustments, meditation exercises, and straight-from-the-heart advice, Cohen guides readers into a more alive and joyful life, even in the midst of pain. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Darlene Cohen is a Zen teacher who counsels chronic pain clients and gives arthritis workshops, classes, lectures, and pain seminars in private practice and at medical facilities and meditation centers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Spokane, Washington, and Evanston, Illinois.

Richard J. Aldrich makes extensive use of recently declassified files in order to examine the politics of secret service during the war against Japan, analyzing the development of organizations such as the Special Operations Executive and the Office of Strategic Services in Asia. He argues that, from the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Allies focused increasingly on each other&#39;s future ambitions, rather than the common enemy. Central to this theme are Churchill, Roosevelt and their rivalry over the future of the role of Asia. Richard J. Aldrich&#39;s cogent, fluent analysis of the role of intelligence in Far Eastern developments is the most thorough and penetrating account of this latterday &#34;Great Game&#34; yet produced.

Reissue.</p><p>Jody Lynn Nye is the young American author of several critically acclaimed novels. Anne McCaffrey is a past winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards. Her most celebrated series is the Dragonrider&#39;s of Pern saga.A new entry in McCaffrey's Brain/Brawn series begun with The Ship Who Sang (1969) and continued by McCaffrey with various collaborators. The Brain here is Carialle, a bodiless human wired into spaceship SSS-900; the Brawn is supplied by Carialle's human partner, Keff. Explorers Carialle and Keff hope to achieve alien contact. Unfortunately, they also need to make discoveries that generate money and kudos: Cencom might not renew their contract, since a prior unpleasant experience has left Carialle psychologically vulnerable to bureaucratic shutdown. On the chilly planet Ozran they discover a population of furry humanoids ruled by irascible and arrogant ``wizards'' wielding what apparently are magic powers. The wizards take Keff captive but do not immediately learn of Carialle's existence. Keff is aided by Plennafrey, a young, beautiful, and rebellious wizard, and the more powerful Chaumel, who is at least willing to listen. Carialle, you see, has discovered that the source of the wizards' power is a projector called the core of Ozran, set up ages ago by one of two long- vanished, advanced alien races. The Core was designed to function as a weather control device, and in using it to power their magic, the wizards have doomed the planet to a slow, cold extinction. Only after Carialle reveals that the ubiquitous globe-frogs are actually the previous masters of Ozran, and that they are willing to help once the wizards cease their bickering, are the wizards persuaded to mend their ways. Bright and bubbly entertainment, though, despite the adult content, decidedly juvenile in style and tone; therefore more likely to appeal to the younger sections of McCaffrey's audience. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Whitman himself made such comparisons, going so far as to use biblical verse as a model for his own. So it&#x2019;s only appropriate that artist and illustrator Allen Crawford has chosen to illuminate&#x2015;like medieval monks with their own holy scriptures&#x2015;Whitman&#x2019;s masterpiece and the core of his poetic vision, &#x201c;Song of Myself.&#x201d; Crawford has turned the original sixty-page poem from Whitman&#x2019;s 1855 edition into a sprawling 234-page work of art. The handwritten text and illustrations intermingle in a way that&#x2019;s both surprising and wholly in tune with the spirit of the poem&#x2015;they&#x2019;re exuberant, rough, and wild. Whitman Illuminated: Song of Myself is a sensational reading experience, an artifact in its own right, and a masterful tribute to the Good Gray Poet.</p><p><p><strong>Walt Whitman</strong> (May 31, 1819 &#x2013; March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works.</p><p><strong>Allen Crawford</strong> is an illustrator, designer, and writer. He and his wife Susan are proprietors of the design/illustration studio Plankton Art Co. Their most notable project to date is the collection of 400 species identification illustrations that are on permanent display at the American Museum of Natural History&#x2019;s Milstein Hall of Ocean Life. Under his pseudonym, Lord Breaulove Swells Whimsy, he wrote, designed, and illustrated The Affected Provincial&#x2019;s Companion, Volume One, which was optioned for film by Johnny Depp&#x2019;s production company, Infinitum Nihil. He lives in Mt. Holly, NJ.</p>FOREWARD <br> <br>I live outside of Philadelphia, where Walt Whitman spent his last decades. I know the wooded banks of Big Timber Creek, where he rested and slowly recovered from the stroke he suffered after the Civil War. I&#x2019;ve kayaked in the cove behind Petty&#x2019;s Island on the Delaware River, where Whitman would picnic on weekends with his friend and amanuensis, Horace Traubel. I&#x2019;ve visited his Mickle Street house in Camden many times, and have stood in his bedroom, where his metal washtub is tucked under his heavy wooden bed. And I know exactly when the mountain laurels outside his crypt in Harleigh Cemetery are in bloom. <br> <br>I&#x2019;m very fortunate to live in Whitman&#x2019;s former backyard: He left a trove of materials and personal effects for local archivists and historians to sift through. It would have been difficult to do a Whitman-based project if I didn&#x2019;t have close access to the Philadelphia institutions that safeguard his legacy. To hold, feel, smell, and study Whitman&#x2019;s books and letters first-hand enriches the endeavor of giving his work a new incarnation. <br> <br>It&#x2019;s become commonplace, even clich�, to suggest that Whitman&#x2019;s iconic collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, is a kind of sacred American text. Whitman himself made such comparisons, going so far as to use biblical verse as a model for his own. So it seems fitting that his work should be transcribed by hand, the way that monks illuminated Holy Scripture in the Middle Ages. <br> <br>Whitman wanted to create a new form of verse, one that was indigenous to America. He wanted to break free not only in form but also in content: he sought complete candor, not allegory or symbolism. His sensibility was American: exuberant, rough, and wild. He reveled in the vitality and sublimity of the physical. He exalted the nature around and within us. His work is an expression of primal joy: he celebrated our animal senses, and the pleasures of being alive. <br> <br>What you are now holding in your hands is an illustrated interpretation of Whitman&#x2019;s epic poem, �Song of Myself,&#x201d; which is regarded as the thematic core of Leaves of Grass. The version of �Song of Myself&#x201d; used here is from the original 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass. I decided to transcribe and illustrate the 1855 edition because to me, rightly or wrongly, it&#x2019;s the most energetic, raw, and uncompromising. <br> <br>With this book, I&#x2019;ve tried to make the vigor of �Song of Myself&#x201d; tangible. I&#x2019;ve attempted to liberate the words from their blocks of verse, and allow the lines to flow freely about the page, like a stream or a bustling city crowd. The text and imagery in this book are intended to be in keeping with Whitman's unburnished sensibility. In the process, Whitman&#x2019;s sixty-page poem has been protracted into 234 illustrated pages. <br> <br>�Protracted&#x201d; seems a particularly apt word in this case: To complete the book I spent a year in my basement, working well into the wee hours, lapsing into a nocturnal pattern, as I often do with large projects. My setup in the basement is simple: two drafting tables, tracing paper, pens, vellum, and a light box. Each two-page spread started as a thumbnail, and then worked into a full-size pencil layout. It was then inked up, scanned, cleaned up digitally, and edited before being saved as final art. It took about eight to ten hours to complete each two-page spread. By my rough estimate, I devoted about 2,560 hours to this book. During the coldest weeks of winter, I was often wrapped in multiple house robes, socks, boots, and a Russian fur hat. I did my best to make a decent workstation for myself, but at times my shoulders, neck, and wrist were locked up in great pain from holding contorted positions in the cold for hours at a time. Each night I slept with a sock over my hand, which was slathered in sports cream. It didn&#x2019;t always work: Sometimes I felt like an aging baseball player. <br> <br>The book was improvised, not planned. So much effort was put into each spread that I never could work out in advance what I was going to draw on the following day. Each morning I felt as though I was starting all over again. The hardest part was working out what the next image would be. Would it be pictorial? Lyrical? Emblematic? Surreal? Typographical? Playful? <br> <br>I sometimes think of this project as a visual journal that I kept as I explored the wild expanses of Whitman&#x2019;s poem, surveying and documenting each line as I went. I wanted to make this book an object that is viewed as well as read, and I made every effort to encapsulate a complete thought or mood in each spread before moving on to the next cluster of verse. There are parts where the pages spill into each other, but generally each spread retains its own imagery, personality, and mood�although there is an overall visual theme throughout the book to maintain some measure of cohesion. <br> <br>I tried to make sure that I wasn&#x2019;t merely reflecting the poem, which would be redundant, predictable, and boring. I&#x2019;m sure I didn&#x2019;t always succeed, but my goal was to leave an interpretive gap for the reader�or should I say �viewer&#x201d;�between the poem and my visual responses (I&#x2019;m not sure all of the drawings can be properly called �illustrations&#x201d;). My hope is that you will never quite know what to expect when you turn the page. <br> <br>To maintain the reader&#x2019;s interest (and my own), I tried to vary the density and complexity from page to page, alternating between pages crammed with text and pages that incorporate imagery. A few pages have little more than imagery. Deciding what to emphasize was a largely intuitive process as I made my way through the text. <br> <br>Whitman&#x2019;s verse concerns itself with epic sweeps and grand gestures, which means including nearly everything and everyone. Walt did indeed contain multitudes, and I had to follow his lead if I was going to properly serve his words. At times, this could prove exasperating: Keeping up with Whitman&#x2019;s torrents of people and places sometimes felt like riding a bee-stung bison down the aisle of a bus. <br> <br>I found that in order to add anything at all to Whitman&#x2019;s vast panoply of people and places, I had to add a dimension of my own. Events in my daily life affected my approach to each spread, and the Philadelphia of today seeped into the Philadelphia of Whitman&#x2019;s day. Hence, you will find a variety of contemporary or near-contemporary images in this book. To neglect to do so would be a disservice to Whitman&#x2019;s work, which attempts to create a new form of verse for The Here and The Now. <br> <br>For this project, I wanted to use a drawing style that is slightly awkward and plain, with a minimum of self-consciousness. I spent a couple of weeks testing out certain combinations of pens and paper, until I found a pairing that had the kind of friction that prevents facile, fussy flourishes. I hope this rather plainspoken drawing style will suggest or invoke the sensibilities espoused by Whitman: his rough vigor, his earthy frankness, his dreamy expansiveness, and his reverence for life in all its forms. <br> <br>I should give thanks and proper credit to Zak Smith and Matt Kish for inspiring this project. Zak Smith took it upon himself to illustrate every single page of Thomas Pynchon&#x2019;s Gravity&#x2019;s Rainbow, and Matt Kish soon followed by illustrating every single page of Herman Melville&#x2019;s Moby-Dick. Their steadfast devotion to such ambitious self-appointed projects was an inspiration, and so I decided to join them in their quest to lend new interpretations to American classics. I hope more will follow their lead. <br> <br>Those of you interested in Walt Whitman the person should find and read Specimen Days, the biography Walt Whitman: A Life by Justin Kaplan, and the accounts of Horace Traubel. The bluster of Whitman&#x2019;s poems are swept aside to reveal a flawed but down-to-earth, maternally tender human being. Having read these books, I&#x2019;m now certain that I would have loved the man. <br> <br>To attach one&#x2019;s own name to Walt Whitman&#x2019;s, one of the great names of American letters, is an incredibly presumptuous thing to do. I can only hope that I&#x2019;ve atoned for my presumptuousness with my labor, and readers find I&#x2019;ve done the words of The Good Gray Poet some justice. In any case, it was a privilege to make such an attempt. <br> <br>At the close of �Song of Myself,&#x201d; Whitman invites us to look for him under our boot-soles. Now that my work is done, it&#x2019;s my hope that you may also find a little of him under my pen.</p><h2>Intentional Teacher: Choosing the Best Strategies for Young Children&#39;s Learning</h2><p>Bestseller!

In this relentlessly naturalistic portrait, Studs starts out his life full of vigor and ambition, qualities that are crushed by the Chicago youth's limited social and economic environment. Studs's swaggering and vicious comrades, his narrow family, and his educational and religious background lead him to a life of futile dissipation.&nbsp;Ann Douglas provides an illuminating introductory essay to Farrell's masterpiece, one of the greatest novels of American literature.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In 1907, his father, James Farrell, a teamster unable to support his growing family, placed young Jim with his maternal grandparents. It was his grandparents&#x2019; neighborhood in Chicago&#x2019;s South Fifties that would provide the background to Farrell&#x2019;s <b>Studs Lonigan</b> trilogy. Farrell worked his way through the University of Chicago, shedding his Catholic upbringing and absorbing the works of William James, John Dewey, Sigmund Freud, while reading widely in American and European literature: Herman Melville, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, and James Joyce were critical influences on his literary development. &#x201c;<b>Slob</b>&#x201d; (1929), his first published story, was also his first render ing of the real life &#x201c;Studs Lonigan,&#x201d; a young man he had known growing up in Chicago. Farrell&#x2019;s first novel, <b>Young Lonigan</b> was published in 1932, followed by <b>The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan</b> (1934) and <b>Judgment Day</b> (1935)&#x2014;the three volumes making up his celebrated Studs Lonigan trilogy. A prolific writer, Farrell left more than fifty books of stories and novels behind him when he died in 1979. Alongside his masterpiece <b>Studs Lonigan</b>, Farrell&#x2019;s best-known works include the Danny O&#x2019;Neill novels, <b>A World I Never Made</b>, <b>No Star is Lost</b>, <b>Father and Son</b>, and <b>My Days of Anger</b>. James T. Farrell&#x2019;s <b>Studs Lonigan</b> trilogy is also available in Penguin Classics.<p>&nbsp;</p><br><p><b>Ann Douglas </b>teaches English at Columbia University. Her books include <b>Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s</b> and <b>The Feminization of American Culture</b>.</p><p> James T. Farrell's three-volume narrative of the brief, hapless life of William "Studs" Lonigan is a milestone in American literature, but an exceedingly problematical one. No series of volumes calling itself the Library of America would be complete without it, so it is good that Farrell has at last joined his contemporaries (and fellow naturalist writers) John Dos Passos and Theodore Dreiser in that exalted company, but a clinical rereading of the trilogy serves mainly to expose its many weaknesses. In its own day it was a monument, but in ours it is a period piece.</p><p>Like countless others who are now in their sixties or older, I first read Studs Lonigan (in the Modern Library "Giant" edition) when I was a teenager, about half a century ago. It was barely two decades old in the mid-1950s, and still seemed fresh, daring and original. Studs, especially the teenage Studs of Young Lonigan, was someone with whom a boy of the '50s could identify, as he struggled to break free of his loving but stifling family, as he fell into the grip of sexual confusion and longing, as shyness and peer pressure stifled his gentler, loving instincts, as he was gradually smothered by the little Chicago world into which he had been born and then by the Depression.</p><p>Reading Studs Lonigan was an immensely important experience for me, and doubtless many others reading this review would say the same. It was big, ambitious, honest and identifiably American. Even as late as the 1950s American literature was still emerging from the shadows cast by Europe and England, and writers who not merely confronted distinctly American subjects but wrote in distinctly American voices were welcomed with real gratitude and passion. The "Great American Novel" was something people still believed in, or wanted to believe in, and a lot of people thought Studs Lonigan might just be it, if not its almost exact contemporary, John Dos Passos's monumental trilogy, U.S.A.</p><p>It gives me no pleasure to report that seven decades after its publication and on its author's centennial, Studs Lonigan fails to pass one of the essential tests of greatness. Though the core of Studs's story is timeless, the specifics are forced and dated: the stilted language, the pervasive racism and anti-Semitism, the stabs at irony that rarely rise above sarcasm, the rootedness in a time and place that now seem impossibly remote. Opening the book with what can fairly be described as eagerness, I quickly -- indeed almost immediately -- found myself fighting to stay attentive and awake. I also found myself wondering how many readers under the age of 30 would have any patience with Farrell's lumbering prose or would find anything within the trilogy with which to connect.</p><p>The trilogy begins when Studs is 14 years old, preparing to graduate from secondary school, and ends with his death a decade and a half later of heart problems complicated by pneumonia. His story parallels that of his country, which before World War I and during the 1920s was optimistic but declined into despair as the Depression slowly ground hope away. Set in blue-collar Irish-American Chicago, it obviously contains many autobiographical elements, but it would be a mistake to read Studs's story as Farrell's own. Farrell pitied Studs but identified with him only to the extent that they came from the same place and were Irish Catholic. Otherwise, Farrell was clearly angered by his protagonist's passivity, his inarticulateness, his provincialism, his bigotry. The one time Farrell's own voice can be heard clearly and unmistakably comes near the halfway point, when a brief interlude is given to "a University student who had lost his religion," Danny O'Neill:</p><p>"He had been told things, told that the world was good and just, and that the good and just were rewarded, lies completely irrelevant to what he had really experienced; lies covering a world of misery, neuroticism, frustration, impecuniousness, hypocrisy, disease, clap, syphilis, poverty, injustice. . . . He wanted to be a writer. He didn't know how. He wanted to purge himself completely of the world he knew, the world of Fifty-eighth Street, with its God, its life, its lies, the frustrations he had known in it, the hates it had welled up in him. . . . It would all go in a newer, cleaner world. He seethed with sudden dizzying adolescent dreams and visions of this new world. He, too, he would destroy the old world with his pen; he would help create the new world. He would study to prepare himself. He saw himself in the future, delivering great and stirring orations, convincing people, a leader, a savior of the world." </p><p>That of course is precisely what Farrell himself tried to do. Like many other American novelists, poets and playwrights who became prominent during the Depression, he was heavily influenced by socialism and Marxism (though he was a Trotskyite rather than a Leninist, and ultimately became a Cold Warrior who voted for Richard Nixon in 1972) and wrote within the Proletarian tradition. His writing seems to have been motivated at least as much by politics and ideology as by the naturalist belief that fate is determined by environment and circumstances rather than by free will. This may have leant a certain immediacy to his work as it first appeared, but it also ensured that in the long run it would become dated.</p><p>A further difficulty with Studs Lonigan is that Studs himself is a remarkably unappealing character, or so he seems on second encounter. Reading about him as a teenager, I empathized with him, just as other teenagers of the same period empathized with Holden Caulfield. Reading about him as an adult, I found him spineless (not in street brawls, but in human connections), purposeless and self-pitying. He never amounts to anything more than "a leading member of the Fifty-eighth Street bunch," incapable of understanding his friend Helen Shires's insistence "that he was being a fool hanging around Fifty-eighth Street where the bunch made a bum out of everybody." He may be a guys' guy, but the guys are mostly riding one-way tickets to nowhere, to prison or to premature death.</p><p>He's not really stupid, but most of the time he acts so dumb you want to wring his neck. Most teenage boys will identify with his passionate longing for girls and his frustration at being unable to connect with them, but over and over again he leaves no doubt that the fault is entirely his own. He's crazy about Lucy Scanlan, and she seems to return the feeling, but just when he thinks he's reached "a turning point" with her, he blows it because "he wanted to say more, and he couldn't," and then when he sees graffiti -- "STUDS LOVES LUCY" -- he represses his tender feelings for her "because STUDS LONIGAN was an iron man, and when anybody laughed at the iron man, well, the iron man would knock the laugh off the face of Mr. Anybody with the sweetest paste in the mush that Mr. Anybody ever got." Ditto for Helen Shires and Catherine Banahan ("Studs wanted to tell Catherine that Red's wife was not as sweet nor as pretty as she was, but the words choked up on him") and all the other women to whom he is attracted. With each one eventually he begins "to become afraid of himself, of the feelings of love and tenderness," and he backs away into the macho cocoon that is the only place where he feels at home. The same goes for everything else in his life. He quits high school after one year, afraid, apparently, of its challenges and the possibility that he might fail them. He fights repeatedly with his father, but retreats into his father's painting business rather than test himself in something new. From time to time for one reason or another "Studs' conscience bothered him," but rarely for long and never with lasting effect.</p><p>It's hard not to contrast Studs with another Chicago boy, Saul Bellow's Augie March. Studs is Irish and Augie Jewish, but both come from similar circumstances. While Studs succumbs to them, Augie rises above them. While Studs is passive, Augie is positive and hopeful. Some of the difference surely can be attributed to the times in which their authors created them. Farrell wrote Studs Lonigan during a period of widespread working-class unrest and violence against organized labor, and then during the hard early years of the Depression; Bellow wrote The Adventures of Augie March in the prolonged period of optimism that followed World War II. Farrell was a dogged naturalist throughout his adult life, while Bellow emerged from that tradition to find greater strength in individual will. In sum, though both books have their flaws and are seriously dated, Augie March has far more energy, passion and humor and in spirit is more American.</p><p>It should be mentioned that there are language and sentiments in Studs Lonigan that many of today's readers will find deeply offensive. The prejudice against blacks and Jews that is repeatedly expressed in terms now regarded as unacceptable accurately reflects the time and place in which Studs lived, though it certainly is contrary to Farrell's own egalitarian views. To eliminate these words and hatreds would be to whitewash historical truth, but the prospective reader of Studs Lonigan is herewith advised to enter it with eyes wide open. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

In this engaging study Grant Hildebrand discusses ways in which architectural forms emulate some archetypal settings that humans have found appealing&#x2015;and useful to survival&#x2015;from ancient times to the present.<br><br>Speculating that nature has "designed" us to prefer certain conditions and experiences, Hildebrand is interested in how the characteristics of our most satisfying built environments mesh with Darwinian selection. In examining the appeal of such survival-based characteristics he cites architectural examples spanning five continents and five millennia. Among those included are the Palace of Minos, the Alhambra, Wells cathedral, the Shinto shrine at Ise, the Piazza San Marco, Brunelleschi's Pazzi Chapel, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, a Seattle condominium, and recent houses by Eric Owen Moss and Arne Bystrom.<br><br>Just what characteristics bestow evolutionary benefits? "Refuge and prospect" offer a protective place of concealment close to a foraging and hunting ground. "Enticement" invites the safe exploration of an information-rich setting where worthwhile discoveries await. "Peril" elicits an emotion of pleasurable fear and so tests and increases our competence in the face of danger: thus the attraction of a skyscraper or a house poised over a vertiginous ravine. "Order and complexity" tease our intuitions for sorting complex information into survival-useful categories.<br><br>Gracefully written, with excellent illustrations that complement the text, <i>Origins of Architectural Pleasure</i> will open the reader's eyes to new ways of seeing a home, a workplace, a vacation setting, even a particular table in a restaurant. It also suggests important design considerations for buildings with a more pressing mandate for human appeal, such as hospitals, retirement homes, and hospices.</p><p>"Grant Hildebrand gives a vivid and cogent analysis of the ingredients that have made beautiful places throughout history, explaining what in our nature makes us feel that way. The examples and illustrations are striking and provide a compelling argument for his thesis. Important reading for anyone interested in the theory and practice of inventing a new architecture."&#x2015;Robert J. Frasca, NAIA<br><br>"Hildebrand's notions of prospect and refuge, enticement, peril, and complex order open up views to an architectural thinking that is grounded in bio-cultural and ecological understandngs of spatial situations, thus complementing our quest for beauty. In fact, Grant Hildebrand suggests that aesthetic choice itself has motivation in early evolutionary stategies for survival. In order to provide satisfactory domicile for the urban dweller of the third millennium, architecture must continue to acknowledge the hunter, gatherer, and farmer concealed in the genetic coding of human behavior."&#x2015;Juhani Pallasma, Architect<br><br>"This is a book of great originality, importance, and relevance. Grant Hildebrand offers us extraordinary insights regarding the dual and interactive relation of human biology and culture in the formation of our aesthetic responses to the built environment. His book could be very helpful to those architects, planners, and environmentalists seeking to better capture and restore the human biological relation to nature in our various architectural forms."&#x2015;Stephen Kellert, author of <i>The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Existence</i><br><b>Grant Hildebrand</b> is Professor of Architecture and Art History at the University of Washington, Seattle, and the author of <i>The Wright Space: Pattern and Meaning in Frank Lloyd Wright's Houses</i> (1991).</p><h2>Jefferson&#39;s Second Revolution: The Election Crisis of 1800 and the Triumph of Republicanism</h2><p>Discusses the constitutional crisis that ensued when Republican Thomas Jefferson tied with his running mate Aaron Burr, a situation that Congress was supposed to resolve, while the Federalists delayed and plotted and Republicans threatened to take up arms.</p><p>Susan Dunn is a professor of history of ideas at Williams College.1 On the Brink<br><br>Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will all be openly taught and practiced,&#x201d; predicted the Connecticut Courant in the fall of 1800. The air will be rent with the cries of distress, the soil will be soaked with blood, and the nation black with crimes.&#x201d; Hardly more than a dozen years after the path-breaking Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, the outlook for American democracy suddenly appeared grim. There was scarcely a possibility that we shall escape a Civil War,&#x201d; the Courant editorialized.<br>The stability and prosperity of the young republic would abruptly halt if Thomas Jefferson, the vice president of the country and the leader of the Republicans, were to defeat President John Adams in the Electoral College in December 1800 or so Federalists believed. Reasonable, dependable government seemed unlikely to survive the leadership of a man who blithely held that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,&#x201d; indeed, that rebellion was a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.&#x201d; Jefferson was a fanatic,&#x201d; they exclaimed, as they drew lurid pictures of the starry-eyed visionary in love with radical revolution, the great arch priest of Jacobinism and in&#xfb01;delity.&#x201d; The Virginian and his Republicans would turn America upside down, permitting the hoi polloi to govern the nation and unseating the wealthy social elite, long accustomed to wielding political power and governing the nation. Jefferson&#x2019;s election, wrote a Federalist in western Massachusetts, would produce the most serious and alarming evils to this Country.&#x201d;<br><br>Something had to be done to save the country from the fangs of Jefferson,&#x201d; cried an anxious Alexander Hamilton. The Virginian&#x2019;s radical promises of liberty, equal rights, and a redistribution of wealth and property, another Federalist declared, would introduce anarchy, which would surely terminate, as it had in France, in military despotism.<br>People whispered about his Congo Harem&#x201d; and dusky Sally Hemings.&#x201d; They were incensed at his lack of respect for religion. It had come to light, an outraged Robert Troup reported to his friend Rufus King, the American minister in London, that Jefferson had once been indiscreet enough to attend a public entertainment in Virginia on a Sunday! What better proof of his contempt for the Christian religion and his devotion to the new religion of France&#x201d;?<br><br>For months during the spring and summer of 1800, Federalist editors throughout the country had been fulminating against the Virginian, smearing him for being an atheist, a dreamer, a coward, a man entirely lacking in conscience, religion, and charity. Do you believe in the strangest of all paradoxes,&#x201d; demanded one of Jefferson&#x2019;s foes in the New York Commercial Advertiser, that a spendthrift, a libertine, or an atheist is quali&#xfb01;ed to make your laws and govern you and your posterity?&#x201d; Writers denounced him for seeking to poison the minds and destroy the morals of the people while spreading the seeds of confusion, anarchy, and slavery throughout the United States. And not only morality, but economic prosperity too, they concluded, would suffer.<br>Commerce would be plundered, farmers impoverished, and merchants ruined. Shadows, clouds, and darkness rest on our future prospects,&#x201d; wrote Troup dejectedly to his friend King.<br><br>And then, in the middle of the summer heat, jolting news! Jefferson was dead! For more than a week in early July 1800, newspapers carried shocking but uncon&#xfb01;rmed reports of the Virginian&#x2019;s sudden death.<br>Sadly the Baltimore American relayed an alarming and truly melancholy report&#x201d; that Thomas Jefferson is no more.&#x201d; He seemed to have died in a sudden manner, the Philadelphia True American informed its startled readers the following day. The next day, the Federalist newspaper, the Gazette of the United States, af&#xfb01;rmed that the report of Mr.<br>Jefferson&#x2019;s death appears to be entitled to some credit.&#x201d;Had the author of the Declaration of Independence fallen ill or been assassinated?"<br><br>Three days later, the American Daily Advertiser still could not disprove the distressing information&#x201d; that Jefferson had mysteriously died. Old Tories&#x201d; and haters of our independence&#x201d; were giving one another sly winks of congratulations,&#x201d; reported the Republican newspaper, the Aurora.<br><br>A week later, the story still remained in doubt. One Federalist, writing in the Connecticut Courant, explained tongue-in-cheek that it had been a slow news week, and some compassionate being,&#x201d; seeking to provide the country with noteworthy news, had very humanely killed Mr. Jefferson.&#x201d; When the reports were exposed as false, Republican newspapers took aim at the Federalists&#x2019; glee. The asses of ariistocracy, fearing the paws of this republican lion, reported his death because they wished him so!&#x201d;<br><br> I have never enjoyed better and more uninterruptedd health,&#x201d; a vigoooorous, unperturbed Jefferson wrote upon receiving news of his own passing.<br>His friend, Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours, had just written to him to describe his great relief when he learned that the reports of Jefferson&#x2019;s death were false. I am much indebted to my enemies,&#x201d; Jefferson responded, for proving by their recitals of my death, that I have friends.&#x201d;<br><br>The &#xfb01;fty-seven-year-old vice president was alive and well in Monticello.<br>The presiding of&#xfb01;cer of the Senate, he had been delighted to leave Philadelphia in May of 1800 for his hilltop home in Virginia. The Senate, he felt, did not have enough business to occupy it for a halfhour a day, while the beloved estate he had so carefully planned and created for himself fully occupied his mind and, as he said, grati&#xfb01;ed his esthetic senses.<br><br>In Monticello, he would wake at dawn, slip out of his alcove bed, and spend the &#xfb01;rst hours of the morning in the adjacent cabinet,&#x201d; reading and working on his voluminous correspondence. Then came breakfast with other members of the household at eight o&#x2019;clock. After breakfast there was time to give thought to the university he was planning, to contemplate more alterations to his house, which was in a state of perpetual redesign and reconstruction, and to pursue his scienti&#xfb01;c inquiries and inventions. Science, he told his friends and family, was his passion,&#x201d; whereas politics was a duty&#x201d; as well as a torment.&#x201d;<br><br>Letters streamed in from all over the country keeping him in close touch with political events. Still, Jefferson wanted to be passive during these election months, trusting his friends and collaborators to campaign on his behalf as well as to respond to the calumnies of the newspapers.&#x201d; The only truth to be relied on in a newspaper,&#x201d; he quipped, was contained in its advertisements. Surveying his land on horseback, attending to his crops, playing with his grandchildren, conversing with his guests, he was content to spend his time in his refuge of mountains, forests, rivers, gardens, books, inventions, and ideas.<br> Is this the violent democrat, the vulgar demagogue, the bold atheist . . . I have so often heard denounced by the federalists?&#x201d; wondered a captivated Margaret Bayard Smith, the wife of the editor of the National Intelligencer, when she &#xfb01;rst met Jefferson in December of 1800.<br> Can this man so meek and mild, yet digni&#xfb01;ed in his manners, with a voice so soft and low, with a countenance so benignant and intelligent, can he be that daring leader of a faction, that disturber of the peace, that enemy of all rank and order?&#x201d;<br><br>But Federalists were not as enchanted by the Virginian&#x2019;s courtly manners, pensive eyes, and gentle, lilting voice. His intellectual stature and distinguished public service author of the Declaration of Independence, member of the Virginia House of Burgesses at the age of twenty-six, wartime governor of Virginia, delegate to the Continental Congress, minister to France, secretary of state under George Washington, vice president under John Adams left them unimpressed. Perhaps in the little republic of St. Marino Jefferson&#x2019;s political experiments&#x201d; could be tolerated, observed Charles Carroll of Carrollton, but in America the Virginian&#x2019;s fantastic tricks&#x201d; would most assuredly dissolve the union.<br><br>Carroll and his patrician Federalist friends not only wanted to remain at the helm, from which they had so ably steered the country toward stability and prosperity, but they believed that they were entitled to remain there. Clinging to the myth of the virtue of the elite few, they were convinced that only they possessed a deep commitment to public service and an unerring sense of the common good.How could the nation survive and &#xfb02;ourish without them, the wise &amp; good,&#x201d; asked Alexander Hamilton, one of the Federalist leaders. Obedience and submission to the powers that be,&#x201d; a Pennsylvania congressman declared, is the duty of all.&#x201d; In private, the Federalist governor of New York, John Jay, was just as blunt. Con&#xfb02;ating power and property, he candidly con&#xfb01;ded to a friend that those who own the country ought to participate in the government of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Oddly, the pedigreed, patrician Jefferson was one of those owners&#x201d; of the country wealthier and from a more distinguished family than Federalists like Adams and the self-made Hamilton. And yet Jefferson sought to challenge their hold on power their strident exclusivism,&#x201d; in the words of historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick and even challenge the legacy of the great George Washington. The father of the country and his closest disciples, Federalists believed, had created and bequeathed to America an orderly society and well-functioning institutions. Our government is as free as it is capable of being the country as happy as a government can make it,&#x201d; they crowed.<br> What more do you want? Will you grasp at a shadow, and lose the substance?&#x201d;<br><br>What principles guided Jefferson and his so-called Republicans? The Jeffersonian brand of republicanism, Federalists scoffed, simply meant an essential want of integrity, and an unprincipled pursuit of whatever promotes the interests, or grati&#xfb01;es the passions of the individuals.&#x201d; In short, Republicans were motivated only by base self-interest&#x201d; whereas Federalists were proud to be anti-individualists, committed to the notion of the common good of all.<br><br>Violence and anarchy would spread through the nation, a Christian Federalist&#x201d; warned in a political pamphlet, if Jefferson won the presidency.<br>Serious, thoughtful men could not doubt, he wrote, that if Jefferson was elected, he and his Jacobin cronies would trample and explode those morals which protect our lives from the knife of the assassin which guard the chastity of our wives and daughters from seduction and violence defend our property from plunder and devastation, and shield our religion from contempt and profanation.&#x201d; Just as wild, radical Jacobins and their guillotines had transformed France into a vast cemetery, Republicans too would leave in their wake a nation in ruins. By what right were these brazen Republicans calling into question the precious status quo?<br><br>Surely in a democracy in which the people were sovereign, the Republicans, though political outsiders, had the right to criticize and oppose those who governed. And yet, some Federalists proposed that a few bold strokes&#x201d; be used to silence all opposition to government.<br>But Republicans refused to be silent. They offered voters a forceful platform and an aggressive agenda for change. They blasted John Jay&#x2019;s recent one-sided treaty with Great Britain in which the English had made few concessions to American claims. They attacked Adams and the other Federalists for passing the repressive Sedition Act in 1798, designed to smother opposition to the Federalist regime. They denounced the standing federal army, warning that it could be used to quash domestic dissent. They condemned the dispatching of federal troops in 1799 to crush a tax revolt Fries&#x2019;s Rebellion in Pennsylvania.<br>Republicans pounded home their message: a simple government, low taxes, state militias instead of a standing army, repeal of the Sedition Act, and free schools. In the South and the burgeoning West, they attracted voters by offering security for slavery, access to new unsettled lands, and markets for their agricultural products. In New England, their democratic message appealed to voters with aspirations of upward mobility.<br><br>Most of all, Republicans criticized the Federalist monocrats&#x201d; for upholding the rights of the few and ignoring the rights of the many, for catering to the social and &#xfb01;nancial elite, for disdaining the people and democracy itself. Even Federalist Gouverneur Morris, the former minister to France and now the junior senator from New York, conceded that his Federalist colleagues had given Republicans reason to believe that they wished to establish a monarchy. The Republicans&#x2019; af&#xfb01;nity for inclusion contrasted sharply with Federalist elitism. The election, declared Massachusetts Republican Elbridge Gerry, was a battle between the people and a party utterly devoted to amonarchical system.&#x201d;A Republican victory was essential, insisted Governor James Monroe of Virginia, to restore to Americans the principles of 1776, to secure to us forever those liberties that were acquired by our revolution, which ought never to have been put in danger.&#x201d;<br><br>By the late fall of 1800, most of the electors to the Electoral College had been selected. State legislatures had either chosen their presidential electors themselves or permitted voters to choose them in statewide or districtwide elections. In some states, it was winner-take-all.<br><br>The Electoral College was an indirect and largely undemocratic method for choosing a president. At the Constitutional Convention, it had been less the product of consensus or compromise than of delegates simply throwing up their hands in frustration. Indeed, no subject at the Philadelphia convention had perplexed the delegates more than the mode of choosing the president. Three times delegates had approved motions that the executive be chosen by the national legislature the equivalent of a parliamentary system but toward the end of the convention they were back to square one, having rejected every proposal for electing the executive. A Committee on Detail &#xfb01;nally settled on the system of electors, and, by that time, the other fatigued and impatient delegates were in no mood to revisit the question again.<br><br>Now, after months of campaigning, it appeared that Federalists would win all of New England&#x2019;s electoral votes, along with those of New Jersey, and would split the votes of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Maryland, gaining 65 votes. Republicans had won all the electoral votes of New York State and most of the South: they too could count on 65 votes. It was unclear for whom South Carolina would cast its 8 electoral votes.<br><br> This is the day appointed for the election of President and Vice President,&#x201d; Troup wrote to King from New York on a cool December morning. On that day, December 3, 1800, presidential electors all met in their respective states and cast their votes. The calculations now are that Adams and Pinckney will outrun Jefferson &amp; Burr,&#x201d; Troup informed his friend. But he was wrong.<br><br>Of&#xfb01;cial Electoral College results from the outlying states trickled in slowly, but there was little doubt that Republicans had won. Jefferson seemed to have 73 votes; John Adams, 65. The mood of the country had swung around. On December 15, the National Intelligencer reported a victory for Republicans and for democracy: The storm, which has so long raged in the political world, has at length subsided,&#x201d; the Intelligencer declared, encouraging Americans to celebrate an ev...</p><h2>Physics for Scientists &amp; Engineers With Modern Physics</h2><p><p><b> </b>Physics for Scientists and Engineers combines outstanding pedagogy with a clear and direct narrative and applications that draw the reader into the physics. The new edition features an unrivaled suite of media and on-line resources that enhance the understanding of physics. <b> </b>Many new topics have been incorporated such as: the Otto cycle, lens combinations, three-phase alternating current, and many more. New developments and discoveries in physics have been added including the Hubble space telescope, age and inflation of the universe, and distant planets. Modern physics topics are often discussed within the framework of classical physics where appropriate. <b> </b>For scientists and engineers who are interested in learning physics. </p></p><p>A comprehensive, rigorous introduction to physics -- with careful and detailed development of physics principles and a strong emphasis on problem solving.PREFACE A Brand New Third Edition <p> It has been more than ten years since the second edition of this calculus-based introductory physics textbook was published. A lot has changed since then, not only in physics itself, but also in how physics is presented. Research in how students learn has provided textbook authors new opportunities to help students learn physics and learn it well. </p><p> </p><p> This third edition comes in two versions. The standard version covers all of classical physics plus a chapter on special relativity and one on the early quantum theory. The extended version, with modern physics, contains a total of nine detailed chapters on modern physics, ending with astrophysics and cosmology. This book retains the original approach: in-depth physics, concrete and nondogmatic, readable. </p><p> This new third edition has many improvements in the physics and its applications. Before discussing those changes in detail, here is a list of some of the overall changes that will catch the eye immediately. </p><p> Full color throughout is not just cosmetic, although fine color photographs do help to attract the student readers. More important, full color diagrams allow the physics to be displayed with much greater clarity. We have not stopped at a 4-color process; this book has actually been printed in 5 pure colors (5 passes through the presses) to provide better variety and definition for illustrating vectors and other physics concepts such as rays and fields. I want to emphasize that color is used pedagogically to bring out the physics. For example, different types of vectors are given different colors see the chart on page xxxi. </p><p> Many more diagrams, almost double the number in the previous edition, have all been done or redone carefully using full color; there are many more graphs and many more photographs throughout. See for example in optics where new photographs show lenses and the images they make. </p><p> Marginal notes have been added as an aid to students to (i) point out what is truly important, (ii) serve as a sort of outline, and (iii) help students find details about something referred to later that they may not remember so well. Besides such "normal" marginal notes, there are also marginal notes that point out brief problem solving hints, and others that point out interesting applications. </p><p> The great laws of physics are emphasized by giving them a marginal note all in capital letters and enclosed in a rectangle. The most important equations, especially those expressing the great laws, are further emphasized by a tan-colored screen behind them. </p><p> Chapter opening photographs have been chosen to illustrate aspects of each chapter. Each was chosen with an eye to writing a caption which could serve as a kind of summary of what is in that chapter, and sometimes offer a challenge. Some chapter-opening photos have vectors or other analysis superimposed on them. </p><p> Page layout: complete derivations. Serious attention has been paid to how each page was formatted, especially for page turns. Great effort has been made to keep important derivations and arguments on facing pages. Students then don't have to turn back to check. More important, readers repeatedly see before them, on two facing pages, an important slice of physics. </p><p> Two kinds of Examples: Conceptual Examples and Estimates. New Physics </p><p> The whole idea of a new edition is to improve, to bring in new material, and to delete material that is verbose and only makes the book longer or is perhaps too advanced and not so useful. Here is a brief summary of a few of the changes involving the physics itself.

First of all, a major effort has been made to not throw everything at the students in the first few chapters. The basics have to be learned first; many aspects can come later, when the students are more prepared. Secondly, a great part of this book has been rewritten to make it clearer and more understandable to students. Clearer does not always mean simpler or easier. Sometimes making it "easier" actually makes it harder to understand. Often a little more detail, without being verbose, can make an explanation clearer. Here are a few of the changes, big and small:</p><p>new graphs and diagrams to clarify velocity and acceleration; deceleration carefully treated. unit conversion now a new Section in Chapter 1, instead of interrupting kinematics. circular motion: Chapter 3 now gives only the basics, with more complicated treatment coming later: non-uniform circular motion in Chapter 5, angular variables in Chapter 10. Newton's second law now written throughout as ma = &#x3a3;F, to emphasize inclusion of all forces acting on a body. Newton's third law follows the second directly, with inertial reference frames placed earlier. New careful discussions to head off confusion when using Newton's third law. careful rewriting of chapters on Work and Energy, especially potential energy, conservative and nonconservative forces, and the conservation of energy. renewed emphasis that &#x3a3;&#x3a4; = I&#x3b1; is not always valid: only for an axis fixed in an inertial frame or if axis is through the cm (Chapters 10 and 11). rolling motion introduced early in Chapter 10, with more details later, including rolling with and without slipping. rotating frames of reference and Coriolis, moved later, to Chapter 11, shortened, optional, but still including why an object does not fall straight down on Earth. fluids reduced to a single chapter (13); some topics and details dropped or greatly shortened. clearer details on how an object floats (Chapter 13). distinction between wave interference in space, and in time (beats) (Chapter 16). thermodynamics reduced to four chapters; the old chapters on Heat and on the First Law of Thermodynamics have been combined into one (19), with some topics shortened an</p></p><h2>Where Do Babies Come From: For Girls Ages 7-9 (Learning About Sex for the Christian Family)</h2><p>This book, the second in the Learning About Sex series for girls, aids parents in the often difficult task of introducing and explaining human sexuality.

As a group, we as women negotiate four times less often than our male counterparts, resulting in getting less of what we want and need: financial security, career advancement, even control over our lifestyles. In my roles as a workplace consultant, a women's leadership columnist, and a recovering "negotiation avoider" myself, I've witnessed countless women continue to sidestep negotiating, choosing instead to live with an inconvenient or less than optimal situation. This matters because research shows that women are happiest between the ages of 18 to 25 and after age 50--that is when, for many, converging life demands like kids and work are less pronounced. Being fulfilled and happy during our most productive time in our professional lives often require us to invent new, better terms and to get "yes" decisions from others. In <i>Pushback</i>, I argue that if women negotiate for better conditions, they will see leaps in their confidence, happiness, and life circumstances. <br><br> <b>You interviewed 20 female executives as the basis for your research. What about these interviews surprised you?</b><br> What surprised me most was the participants' response when I asked them to quantify the impact of pushing back. I asked interviewees, "Assuming a woman's career success equals 100 percent, what percentage is accounted for by her effectiveness in negotiating and pushing back?" Averaging the twenty responses I heard, the answer was 60 percent; that's to say that 60 percent of a woman's career success hinges on her pushback skills--holding her own, advocating her needs, and negotiating. Although technical skills, academic or business pedigree, and people skills emerged as necessities for those who want to lead, command of your own voice and ability to advocate, according to successful women executives, ranked higher. I didn&#x2019;t expect the response to be quite that affirmative. <br><br> <b><i>Pushback</i> could be interpreted as a combative--even negative--term. How do you define it?</b><br> The word is definitely more commonly used to mean resistance, but I am using it rather more broadly--and more positively. In the context of this book and the interviews I conducted, pushback represents the group of skills that allow us to take a stand, be firm, or advocate on our own behalf. It also encompasses our adeptness at advancing a cause, making a request, and persuading others of the merits of our view. We can use it to go after what we want, and we can use it to defend what is ours and what we need. <br><br> <b>You say that, financially speaking, women's propensity to avoid negotiating "devastates their potential." What are the effects you've observed?</b><br> When we don't negotiate our salaries, we leave thousands, even millions, of dollars on the table unclaimed. This not only affects us negatively right now, but drastically dwarfs the retirement savings we work so hard to accumulate. Nationally, women do not yet earn comparable wages to men--and then add to that that we are more likely to leave the paid workforce to manage caretaking responsibilities. With nearly half of all marriages ending in divorce, our own share of earnings becomes even more of an important lifeline. Women may also have a tendency to let males take care of bills and savings and yet we live longer than men, which means in the end, we are the ones literally left holding the purse. When we're not the chief negotiator of our own finances and lives, our economic stability and vitality is greatly endangered. <br><br> <b>In a recession, is it still possible to negotiate on the job?</b><br> Workplace negotiations, even today, represent some of the most lush and productive places for negotiating, not to mention the most materially significant. I'm not just referring to salary requests, but negotiations about flexible arrangements, maternity leave plans, part-time work schedules--even which work assignments we take on or lead. Many companies are perfectly willing to make case-by-case determinations about money, roles, or career paths and there's less of a trend today requiring that all employees conform to one strict hierarchy or career ladder. As I teach readers in <i>Pushback</i>, it's up to each of us to do our homework, make an irrefutable case, and then persuade our counterpart so that it's very hard for them to say "no." <br><br> <b>Do the youngest working women--Gen Y'ers--require negotiation skills?</b><br> Yes, and perhaps even more so than older generations. When queried, Gen Y women report that, (1) their most closely held value is independence and that, (2) their primary career goal is entrepreneurship. This suggests that those young women who do join the traditional workforce will expect control over how and what they do. What's more, they're looking for hybrid career opportunities--ones that allow them to cross-pollinate their work and outside interests and personal and professional lives. The skills of negotiating and self advocacy will therefore be career necessities in a work world that's still fairly rigid, where young women want choice and diversity in their work. <br><br> <b>Do you think there&#x2019;s a formula for learning to negotiate well?</b><br> I do. In <i>Pushback</i>, I present a complete process for negotiation--not just as a one-time transaction, but as an everyday skill. The system I've developed over the last several years teaches women four critical, repeatable steps for negotiating with finesse. It works incredibly well. Women who learn and practice these negotiation tactics benefit financially, find solutions and opportunities where there were previously none, and often get more of what they wanted than they originally asked for. One woman I heard from informed me that after negotiating her role at a dead-end job, her employer asked her to write her dream description, noting that they'd bend over backward to keep her. These kinds of stories abound when women prepare for a request and make the "ask." By setting our sights high, we can challenge the syndrome that leaves so many people ailing from uncontested, low expectations. <br> <br><br>&#34;Silver Award Winner - Women/Minorities in Business.&#34;- Axiom Business Book Awards</p><h2>Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial</h2><p><p><b>"Astringent and absorbing. . . . <i>Iphigenia in Forest Hills</i> casts, from its first pages, a genuine spell &#x2014; the kind of spell to which Ms. Malcolm&#x2019;s admirers (and I am one) have become addicted."</b>&#x2014;Dwight Garner, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>"She couldn't have done it and she must have done it." This is the enigma at the heart of Janet Malcolm's riveting new book about a murder trial in the insular Bukharan-Jewish community of Forest Hills, Queens, that captured national attention. The defendant, Mazoltuv Borukhova, a beautiful young physician, is accused of hiring an assassin to kill her estranged husband, Daniel Malakov, a respected orthodontist, in the presence of their four-year old child. The prosecutor calls it an act of vengeance: just weeks before Malakov was killed in cold blood, he was given custody of Michelle for inexplicable reasons. It is the "Dickensian ordeal" of Borukhova's innocent child that drives Malcolm's inquiry.</p><p>With the intellectual and emotional precision for which she is known, Malcolm looks at the trial&#x2014;"a contest between competing narratives"&#x2014;from every conceivable angle. It is the chasm between our ideals of justice and the human factors that influence every trial&#x2014;from divergent lawyering abilities to the nature of jury selection, the malleability of evidence, and the disposition of the judge&#x2014;that is perhaps most striking.</p><p>Surely one of the most keenly observed trial books ever written, <i>Iphigenia in Forest Hills</i> is ultimately about character and "reasonable doubt."

Requires only a working knowledge of algebra, and makes extensive use of spreadsheets. Includes an accompanying diskette of programs and data files. <b></b> This book offers unique, comprehensive, up-to-date coverage of both igneous <i>and</i> metamorphic petrology <i>in a single volume</i> and provides the quantitative and technical background required to critically evaluate igneous and metamorphic phenomena. <b></b> For anyone interested in petrology. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This text is designed for use in advanced undergraduate or early graduate courses in igneous and metamorphic petrology. The book is extensive enough to be used in separate igneous and metamorphic courses, but I use it for a one-semester combined course by selecting from the available chapters. The nature of geological investigations has largely shaped the approach that I follow. </p><p> Geology is often plagued by the problem of inaccessibility. Geological observers really see only a tiny fraction of the rocks that compose the Earth. Uplift and erosion exposes some deep-seated rocks, whereas others are delivered as xenoliths in magma, but their exact place of origin is vague at best. As a result, a large proportion of our information about the Earth is indirect, coming from melts of subsurface material, geophysical studies, or experiments conducted at elevated temperatures and pressures. </p><p> The problem of inaccessibility has a temporal aspect as well. Most Earth processes are exceedingly slow. As a result, we seldom are blessed with the opportunity of observing even surface processes at rates that lend themselves to ready interpretation (volcanism is a rare exception for petrologists). In most other sciences, theories can be tested by experiment. In geology, as a rule, flat experiment has run to its present state and is impossible to reproduce. Our common technique is to observe the results and infer what the experiment was. Most of our work is thus inferential and deductive. Rather than being repulsed by this aspect of our work, I believe most geologists are attracted by it. </p><p> The nature of how geology is practiced has changed dramatically in recent years. Early geologists worked strictly in the observational and deductive fashion described above. The body of knowledge resulting from the painstaking accumulation of data observable with the naked eye or under a light microscope is impressive, and most of the theories concerning how the Earth works that were developed by the mid-20th century are still considered valid today, at least in broad terms. Modern post-war technology, however, has provided geologists with the means to study the Earth using techniques borrowed from our colleagues in the fields of physics and chemistry. We have mapped and sampled much of the ocean basins; we have probed the mantle using variations in gravity and seismic waves; we can perform chemical analyses of rocks and minerals quickly and with high precision; we can also study natural and synthetic specimens at elevated temperatures and pressures in the laboratory to approximate the conditions at which many rocks formed within the Earth. These and other techniques, combined with theoretical models and computing power, have opened new areas of research and have permitted us to learn more about the materials and processes of the Earth's interior. These modern techniques have been instrumental in the development of plate tectonic theory, the encompassing paradigm that guides much present geologic thought. Given the limitations of inaccessibility mentioned above, it is impressive how much we have learned about our planet. Modern petrology, because it, addresses processes that occur hidden from view deep within the Earth, must rely heavily on data other than simple observation. </p><p> In the pages that follow I shall attempt to explain the techniques employed, and the resulting insights they provide into the creation of the igneous and metamorphic rocks now found at the surface of the Earth. The reader should be aware, however, that the results of our investigations, however impressive and consistent they may appear, are still based in large part on indirect evidence and inferential reasoning. I'm sure that the many researchers whose painstaking work we shall review would join me in urging a healthy skepticism lest we become too dogmatic in our perspective. Ideas and theories are always in a state of flux. Many of today's ideas may be discarded tomorrow as new information becomes available and/or other ideas take their place. Certainly petrology is not exempt from this process. If so, it would be far too dull to pursue. </p><p> The term petrology comes from the Greek petra (rock) and logos (explanation), and means the study of rocks and the processes that produce them. Such study includes description and classification of rocks, as well as interpretation of their origin. Petrology is subdivided into the study of the three major rock types: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. At the undergraduate level in most colleges and universities, sedimentary petrology is taught as a separate course, usually with stratigraphy. Igneous and metamorphic petrology are commonly combined, due to the similarity of approach and principles involved. I intend this book for either a combined igneous/metamorphic course or two separate ones. In the interest of brevity, I will henceforth use the term "petrology" to mean the study of igneous and metamorphic rocks and processes. I hope not to offend sedimentary petrologists by this, but it would prove burdensome to continually redraw the distinction. </p><p> I shall concentrate on the processes and principles involved in the generation of igneous and metamorphic rocks, rather than dwell upon lists of details to be memorized. Certainly facts are important (after all, they compose the data upon which the interpretations are based), but when students concentrate on the processes of geology, and the processes by which we investigate them, they get a deeper understanding, more lasting knowledge, and develop skills that will prove valuable beyond the classroom. </p><p> As mentioned above, modern petrology borrows heavily from the fields of chemistry and physics. Indeed, the student taking a petrology course should have completed a year of chemistry, and at least high school physics. Calculus, too, would help, but is not required. Some students, who were attracted to geology for its field bias, are initially put off by the more rigorous chemical and theoretical aspect of petrology. I intend this text to give students some exposure to the application of chemical and physical principles to geological problems, and I hope that some practice will give them confidence in using quantitative techniques. At the same time, I do not want to so burden them that they lose the perspective that this is a course in geology, not chemistry, physics, or computer science. We must bear in mind that the Earth itself is the true proving ground for all the ideas we deal with. Even the most elegant models, theories, and experimental results, if not manifested in the rocks in the field, are useless (and probably wrong as well). </p><p> All textbooks need to balance brevity, breadth, and depth. Whole books are dedicated to such subjects as thermodynamics, trace elements, isotopes, basalts, or even specialized subjects as kimberlites, lamproites, or mantle metasomatism. When distilling this sea of wisdom to an introductory or survey level, vast amounts of material must necessarily be abbreviated or left out. Of course it is up to the author to decide what is to be selected. We each have our own areas of interest, resulting; in a somewhat biased coverage. To those who object to, the light coverage I give to some subjects and my overindulgence in others, I apologize. The coverage here is not intended to replace more specialized classes and. deeper levels of inquiry for those proceeding on to graduate studies in petrology. There is no attempt to develop theoretical techniques, such as thermodynamics or trace. elements from first principles. Rather, enough background is given for a degree of competence with using; the techniques, but the direction is clearly toward application. We gain from our more general perspective a. broad overview of the Earth as a dynamic system that: produces a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks in. a wide range of settings. We will not only learn about: these various settings and the processes that operate. there, but we will develop the skills necessary to evaluate and understand them. Once again, I urge you to be. critical as you progress through this text. Ask yourself if' the evidence presented to support an assertion is adequate. This text is different from texts only 10 years old. We might all wonder what interpretations will change in. a text published 10 years from now. </p><p> Following the traditional approach, I have divided the book into an igneous section and a metamorphic section. Each begins with an introductory chapter, followed by a. chapter on the description and classification of appropriate rock types and a chapter on the development and, interpretation of textures. The chapters on classification. and textures are intended as a laboratory supplement&#x201e; and not for lecture-discussion. I have tried to explain. most petrologic terms as they are presented, but you will. invariably run across terms with which you are unfamiliar. I usually place a new term in bold typeface. If you. forget a term, it can usually be found in the index, but a. dictionary of geological terms is also a good companion.

Ever since, postmodernism has been haunted by the specter of a compromised past. In this intellectual genealogy of the postmodern spirit, Richard Wolin shows that postmodernism's infatuation with fascism has been widespread and not incidental. He calls into question postmodernism's claim to have inherited the mantle of the left--and suggests that postmodern thought has long been smitten with the opposite end of the political spectrum.</p><br><p> In probing chapters on C. G. Jung, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot, Wolin discovers an unsettling commonality: during the 1930s, these thinkers leaned to the right and were tainted by a proverbial "fascination with fascism." Frustrated by democracy's shortcomings, they were seduced by fascism's grandiose promises of political regeneration. The dictatorships in Italy and Germany promised redemption from the uncertainties of political liberalism. But, from the beginning, there could be no doubting their brutal methods of racism, violence, and imperial conquest.</p><br><p> Postmodernism's origins among the profascist literati of the 1930s reveal a dark political patrimony. The unspoken affinities between Counter-Enlightenment and postmodernism constitute the guiding thread of Wolin's suggestive narrative. In their mutual hostility toward reason and democracy, postmodernists and the advocates of Counter-Enlightenment betray a telltale strategic alliance--they cohabit the fraught terrain where far left and far right intersect.</p><br><p> Those who take Wolin's conclusions to heart will never view the history of modern thought in quite the same way.</p></p><p><p>"Richard Wolin's superb book is urgent reading for those who would toss the Enlightenment out with Descartes. In this tour d'horizon, as deep as it iswide, Wolin refuses to be impressed by the glamour of extremity. He shines light into many dark corners where intellectual fraud, self-deception, and hauteur passed for liberty during a murderous century. Talk about genealogy! Unreason will never be the same."<b>--Todd Gitlin, Columbia University, author of <i>The Twilight of Common Dreams</i></b></p><p>"Richard Wolin demonstrates conclusively that contempt for liberalism and parliamentary government, whether it comes from the right or the left, whether it is anti-modern or postmodern, is very bad politics. His learned and provocative 'genealogy' of contemporary anti-Americanism should cause deep anxiety among its intellectual purveyors in Europe and here at hometoo."<b>--Michael Walzer, Institute for Advanced Study</b></p><p>"I recommend this powerful critique with great enthusiasm. It is that infrequent book that is of enduring scholarly significance while deserving of a broad readership outside the academy. It also offers American readers insights into French and German mentalities at a time of transatlantic irritations."<b>--Jeffrey Herf, University of Maryland</b></p><p>"This is a wide-ranging and hard-hitting critique of postmodern thinking--especially of its political limitations and failures--based on broad reading and straight thinking. The author adds relevance to his critique of thinkers by juxtaposing those thinkers with interesting accounts of contemporary European politics."<b>--Jerrold Seigel, New York University</b></p><b>Richard Wolin</b> is Distinguished Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.

It&#x2019;s a myth, an illusion. New scientific research explodes the fable that midlife is a time when things start to go downhill for everybody. In fact, midlife can be a great new adventure, when you can embrace fresh possibilities, purposes, and pleasures. In <i>Life Reimagined</i>, Hagerty explains that midlife is about renewal: It&#x2019;s the time to renegotiate your purpose, refocus your relationships, and transform the way you think about the world and yourself. Drawing from emerging information in neurology, psychology, biology, genetics, and sociology&#x2014;as well as her own story of midlife transformation&#x2014;Hagerty redraws the map for people in midlife and plots a new course forward in understanding our health, our relationships, even our futures.</p><p><b>Barbara Bradley Hagerty&nbsp;</b>is the author of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling&nbsp;<i>Fingerprints of God</i> is also an award-winning journalist who spent nearly 20 years as a correspondent for NPR.

I devoted much of the afternoon to crafting a response to a listener who disliked a story that had aired the previous day on <i>All Things Considered</i>. When you cover a beat such as religion, as I did for many years at National Public Radio, you brace for a hailstorm of outraged e-mails every time you file a report. <br>But I never grew used to them, and this one was particularly up- setting. &nbsp;Just after I sent off my response, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. My breathing became clipped and shallow. &nbsp;Heat radiated up my back. &nbsp;Panicked, I googled &#x201c;heart attack + women.&#x201d; &nbsp;The results were not reassuring&#x2014;are any health-related answers on the Internet reassuring?&#x2014;and I called my doctor, Brad Moore, on his cell phone. I described my symptoms as calmly as I could.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the shortness of breath,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I want you to call<br> 911 immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>I made it partway through &#x201c;I can do that,&#x201d; when the room lurched and went black. &nbsp;When I opened my eyes, my colleague John Ydstie was tucking a soft sweater under my head. &#x201c;An ambulance is on its way<i>,&#x201d; </i>he whispered. Then I heard Scott Simon&#x2019;s voice directing the medics to my cubicle. Dr. Moore, who also sees Scott, had called him when he heard me faint. <br><br>By the time the ambulance reached the George Washington University Hospital, I was feeling pretty good, well enough to go home, in fact. I explained to the nurse that I was a healthy woman who takes a six a.m. spinning class every day. I could not possibly have a bad heart. The nurse looked at me, handed me a hospital gown, and scanned her notes.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fifty-three, right?&#x201d; she asked, as if that number were a clinical condition, like diabetes. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better keep you overnight.&#x201d; <br><br>It occurred &nbsp;to &nbsp;me then &nbsp;that &nbsp;I <i>was </i>suffering &nbsp;from &nbsp;a condition: &nbsp;a physical &nbsp;and emotional&nbsp; &nbsp;condition&nbsp; &nbsp;called &nbsp;&#x201c;midlife.&#x201d; This &nbsp;condition presented &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;disconnect between &nbsp;my &nbsp;thirty-something&nbsp; self-image and my fifty-something &nbsp;reality. &nbsp;I recognized it every time I passed a mirror and saw the lined face of my mother in her fifties staring back at me. I spotted &nbsp;it often &nbsp;at work, &nbsp;when &nbsp;my younger, &nbsp;ambitious &nbsp;self insisted that &nbsp;I clamor to cover that &nbsp;breaking &nbsp;story, while my chronological self shrugged, preferring &nbsp;a good night&#x2019;s &nbsp;sleep to another &nbsp;all-nighter. &nbsp;Sitting there in the thin hospital robe, I admitted &nbsp;there were moments, &nbsp;more &nbsp;and &nbsp;more &nbsp;frequent, &nbsp;when &nbsp;I seemed to be pushing &nbsp;a wheelbarrow full of dense, unfulfilled ambition&nbsp; up a steep gravel path. It was exhausting, but I didn&#x2019;t know any other way to live.<br><br>I was not left to my thoughts for long. Within minutes, my husband, Devin; my brother, Dave; Dr. &nbsp;Moore; &nbsp;and &nbsp;Marty &nbsp;Makary, &nbsp;a good &nbsp;friend &nbsp;and &nbsp;surgeon &nbsp;at Johns &nbsp;Hopkins, had &nbsp;arrived, &nbsp;creating &nbsp;a little &nbsp;party &nbsp;in our &nbsp;corner &nbsp;of the &nbsp;ER. As the five of us chatted and laughed, e-mails from NPR friends and colleagues began filling my iPhone; someone had sent an All Staff e-mail. My dear friend Libby Lewis called to say she would visit early the next morning. I felt loved, I felt cherished. Why hadn&#x2019;t I pulled this stunt before? <br><br>Eventually everyone left, and I was given a bed at two a.m. I awakened with a dull headache a couple of hours later to a persistent beeping from the bed next to me. I gazed at the ceiling, reflecting on my family and friends and how desperately I wanted a cup of coffee. At six-thirty, I called Devin to see if he could bring me a double espresso. I reached him as he was leaving the house.<br><br>&#x201c;You need to call Dave,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just call him,&#x201d; he said uncomfortably.<br><br>Instinctively, I knew: Dad had died. As it turned out, he had died at five that morning, at age ninety-one.<br><br>That night, after I was discharged from the hospital, my family and a few friends collected at my brother&#x2019;s house for dinner.<br><br>&#x201c;Turns out I was with the wrong relative last night,&#x201d; Dave quipped when he ushered us in, and it felt good to laugh.<br><br>We crowded around the kitchen table and began swapping stories about Dad. We remembered how he learned to swing dance when he was sixty-nine, and how at seventy-four, by then two years divorced, Dad spotted Nancy at church and courted her with such charm and devotion that she had to marry him. We talked about how Dad believed in me: When I was struggling in school as a third-grader, how he spent hours helping me with homework and with prayers written out on yellow legal pads. We recalled how Dad studied French every night between two and three a.m., teaching himself vocabulary and grammar. &nbsp;He never progressed &nbsp;beyond &nbsp;terrible &nbsp;at French, but&nbsp; he al- ways &nbsp;insisted &nbsp;that &nbsp;some &nbsp;things &nbsp;are &nbsp;worth &nbsp;doing &nbsp;poorly. &nbsp;I think he meant that some things are so worthwhile that even if you have no talent, even if the results are mediocre, it is still worth your time and effort. In his final years, his mind and body had failed him&#x2014;he was nearly blind, nearly deaf, and suffered from dementia&#x2014;but to the end, Dad lived each day with verve.<br> After hearing that my father had died, Scott Simon sent me a note. He had known Dad. They belonged to the same health club and would occasionally share a cup of coffee, Dad no doubt clueless as to Scott&#x2019;s fame. Scott mentioned that he had told his wife, Caroline, about my health scare and my dad&#x2019;s death.<br><br>&#x201c;Caroline said, &#x2018;Darling, I don&#x2019;t care how far gone someone is, they always feel a tug from their children. &nbsp;Gene wanted to go instead,&#x2019;&#x201d; Scott wrote. &nbsp;&#x201c;We believe that Gene somehow knew that you needed a little help and he said to God, &#x2018;Barbie still has a lot of things to do. I&#x2019;m ready. Take me,&#x2019; and he said it with that incredible chiseled smile. And God said, &#x2018;Gene, you&#x2019;ve got a deal.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Even now, several years later, these words make me cry. They re- mind me that Dad loved me fiercely and would have instantly traded his life for mine. Scott&#x2019;s words &nbsp;also illumined &nbsp;a larger truth: &nbsp;A page had &nbsp;turned, &nbsp;Dad &nbsp;was &nbsp;gone &nbsp;and &nbsp;I was &nbsp;here, ostensibly &nbsp;healthy &nbsp;but keenly aware that a hospital stay or worse was only one stressful event away. I saw it would not be too long before my brother and I would be next at bat, and that the next generation to fall was my own.<br><br>At fifty-three, I gained a new sense of my own mortality. Now, what would I do with that?<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> ONE MYTH AND THREE TRUTHS<br> &nbsp;<br>For the next two years, I examined the middle stage of life. I traveled the country interviewing brain scientists and marriage therapists, psychologists and kidney donors, geneticists and elite masters athletes&#x2014;well over four hundred &nbsp;researchers and ordinary folk trying to figure out how to thrive at midlife. As a result, I have come to believe that the forties, fifties, and sixties are the least understood and, in some ways, the most critical phase of life. Midlife is not flyover territory. &nbsp;Midlife is O&#x2019;Hare, midlife is Heathrow, midlife is a bustling hub where the decisions you make today largely determine the rest of your journey on this planet. &nbsp;What I have learned has been a happy surprise. It has changed the way I try to approach every single day. <br><br>Midlife has gotten a bum rap. It has suffered guilt by association, linked inextricably to the &#x201c;c&#x201d; word: <i>crisis</i>.<br><br>The &nbsp;ugly rumors &nbsp;about &nbsp;midlife &nbsp;began &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;1970s, when &nbsp;Gail Sheehy and others stereotyped midlife as a cataclysmic period surging with existential &nbsp;dread, &nbsp;flattened &nbsp;by malaise, tortured by one&#x2019;s failed dreams, or any combination of the three. In her book <i>Passages, </i>Sheehy wrote of the &#x201c;forlorn forties&#x201d; and the &#x201c;resigned fifties.&#x201d; Eventually the idea captured the popular imagination, becoming plot lines for Oscar- winning (and lesser) movies, and often an excuse for bad behavior. According to the midlife-crisis argument, certain stalwart or blessed personalities could escape the mud pit, but most of us were drawn inexorably into the emotional mire. We have been socialized to think this way about midlife, and&#x2014;what do you know?&#x2014;we all seem to have &#x201c;midlife crises.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, there is almost no hard evidence for midlife crisis at all, other than a few small pilot studies conducted decades ago. Researchers today &nbsp;who &nbsp;have examined &nbsp;people across &nbsp;their &nbsp;life spans, &nbsp;peered inside their brains, uncoiled their hopes and fears, and observed how they deal with love and alienation, &nbsp;trauma &nbsp;and death, &nbsp;good and evil, say that &nbsp;midlife is about &nbsp;renewal, &nbsp;not crisis. This is a time when you shift gears&#x2014;a temporary pause, yes, but not a prolonged stall. In fact, you are moving forward to a new place in life. This moment can be exhilarating rather than terrifying, informed by the experiences of your past and shaped by the promise of your future.<br><br>This is not to say that the middle-aged are a cheerful or carefree lot. If happiness over the life span looks like a U-curve&#x2014;and researchers suggest that it does&#x2014;then people in their forties and fifties occupy the bottom of the curve. They zigzag between demanding children and frail parents. They shoulder heavy responsibilities at work. They are under-rested, under-exercised, and overfed. Yet 90 percent of them are not in crisis. Midlife malaise is fairly ubiquitous, but let&#x2019;s not diminish a legitimate phenomenon with a stereotype. <br><br>When I launched into this admittedly self-serving project&#x2014;after all, this is about me as well as you&#x2014;I knew what to examine. &nbsp;It was like being a first-time tourist to the United States, equipped with a must-see list. When you arrive in Washington, D.C., you must see the White House; in Arizona, the Grand Canyon; in New York City, the Statue of Liberty. &nbsp;But even after roaming through those places, you would not truly understand the country unless you absorbed some of its overriding motifs: democracy, the pursuit of happiness, religious freedom, and eternal optimism.<br><br>In the same way, I had my must-see list of midlife monuments: the (tedious) career, the (distant) marriage, the need for investing outward, or &#x201c;generativity,&#x201d; which psychologist Erik Erikson enshrined as a de- fining characteristic of midlife. But as I looked around, I also spotted three themes that are helpful, and I believe necessary, to living richly in one&#x2019;s middle years.<br> <i><br>Engage with verve. </i>Emotionally disengaging from any part of your life&#x2014;your spouse, your kids, your work&#x2014;cuts off the oxygen and the patient dies. That &nbsp;sounds &nbsp;dire&#x2014;that&#x2019;s &nbsp;my point, &nbsp;actually&#x2014;because this &nbsp;insight &nbsp;surfaced &nbsp;again &nbsp;and &nbsp;again: &nbsp;Autopilot&nbsp; &nbsp;is death. Choose where to invest your energy, and do so intentionally, because the clearest path to a robust midlife is purposeful engagement.<br><br>In some ways, the best role models for people over forty are people under eighteen. Children study hard, learn new skills, and throw them- selves into new passions. &nbsp;They fail like beginners, until frustration yields to success. They risk making and tending to friends, even if that hurts. The lesson for midlifers is: Of course it takes work to inject zest and &nbsp;vulnerability &nbsp;into &nbsp;your &nbsp;marriage; &nbsp;it takes &nbsp;courage &nbsp;to reappraise your career for not &nbsp;just income &nbsp;but &nbsp;also meaning; &nbsp;it takes &nbsp;effort &nbsp;to sharpen your aging brain. But the research is clear: Engaging in those things you feel are important will lift your joy and satisfaction, in the moment and over the years. <br><i><br>Choose purpose over happiness. </i>&#x201c;Happiness is overrated,&#x201d; Carol Ryff told me. Ryff is a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin and director of an enormous project called Midlife in the United States, or MIDUS. For some twenty years, Ryff and other scientists have tracked thousands of people through their middle and later years, measuring their well-being in every possible way: physically, emotionally, psycho- logically, biologically, and neurologically. &nbsp;After sorting through piles of data, the researchers have concluded that pursuing happiness can backfire, but pursuing <i>eudaimonia rarely</i> fails.<br> <i><br>Eudaimonia is</i> the Aristotelian idea of human flourishing, pursuing long-term goals that give meaning to life, rather than short-term happiness that delivers a jolt of dopamine. &nbsp;It is the kind of satisfaction that comes from raising terrific children or training for the Olympics. It means figuring out your purpose in life, given your unique set of talents and capacities. &nbsp;It is the Holy Grail that &nbsp;all people seek, most acutely in middle age, when we can see the final horizon not so many years away.<br><br>It turns out that finding a deeper purpose and pursuing it carries an unexpected bonus: It makes you robust. &nbsp;Dozens of new studies show that if you have a reason to get up in the morning, you will live longer, you will enjoy a happier old age, you will better retain your memory, and you will be more likely to not only survive the scary diagnosis but thrive. Purpose in life is more important than education or wealth in determining long-term health and happiness. It isn&#x2019;t a panacea, but it&#x2019;s awfully close. <br><br><i>Your thinking is your experience. </i>How you think can shape how you experience the world, your career, your relationships, your health, your happiness. &nbsp;Please note &nbsp;that &nbsp;I am&nbsp; <i>not &nbsp;</i>arguing &nbsp;that &nbsp;whistling &nbsp;a happy tune will make you healthy, wealthy, and wise; at least, not entirely. Much of your life and mine is shaped by biology and life circumstances. Genetics&#x2014;who your parents are, whether you are susceptible to mental or physical disease, what your emotional &#x201c;set point&#x201d; is&#x2014;this is the wind thrusting your little boat in a particular direction. &nbsp;Your environment steers you as well, with the force of a strong current: Did you grow up in a safe and nurturing home, or a divided or abusive one? Did you receive a decent education? Are you poor or wealthy? Are you married, employed, religious?<br><br>But there is also a mechanism called a &#x201c;rudder&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, your thinking, your approach to triumphs and defeats, joys and pain and losses, the stuff no one escapes&#x2014;that calibrates one&#x2019;s happiness. &nbsp;Experts believe that 30 to 40 percent of one&#x2019;s happiness is determined by how a person thinks or acts. That rudder won&#x2019;t shelter you from a hurricane as you venture across an ocean, but it will absolutely color how much you enjoy the trip.<br><br>Your thoughts and attitudes today chart your destiny tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> A CIRCUITOUS JOURNEY<br><br>If you are middle-aged today (roughly betw...</p><h2>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Trees: Second Edition</h2><p><p>Popular, award-winning, and unrivaled for its coverage and beauty, this is a magnificent illustrated guide to nearly 2,000 tree species and cultivars found in North America and Europe.

Ball aims straight at kids' natural enthusiasm for puzzles and nifty phenomena in this wide-angle view of math. Readers will find the usual number history, finger-counting tricks, and magic squares here, but Ball extends his purview well beyond typical classroom subjects to touch upon topology, chaos theory, and fractals. Some discussions and exercises will challenge even grown-up brainiacs ("It's possible to make a hole in a postcard-sized piece of paper that a person can step through. Can you work out the pattern?"), but many others (making an icosahedron; performing probability-based card tricks) are spot-on for inquisitive kids who like to fiddle and ponder. Perhaps the only real drawback is the book's design. Fragments of text appear beside distractingly scattered photos, and the jacket's cheerful primary colors seem to target a younger audience than will be capable of absorbing the concepts. Try this on kids who ask for books on Sudoku number squares, and give it to teachers at many levels, who will want to borrow from Ball's pedagogical toolbox. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Where do the long, lazy summers of our childhood go? Why, as we grow older, does time seem to condense, speed up and elude us, while in old age, significant events from our distant past can seem as vivid and real as what happened yesterday? Douwe Draaisma, author of the internationally acclaimed Metaphors of Memory (Cambridge, 2001), explores the nature of autobiographical memory. Applying a unique blend of scholarship, poetic sensibility, and keen observation, he tackles such extraordinary phenomena as deja-vu, near-death experiences, the memory feats of idiot savants, and the effects of extreme trauma on memory recall. Raising almost as many questions as it answers, this fascinating book will not fail to affect you at the same time as it educates and entertains. Douwe Draaisma is Professor of the History of Psychology in the Department of Theory and History of Psychology at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. He has published books on time and memory and his articles have appeared in professional journals as diverse as Annals of Science, Psychological Medicine, and Nature. The original Dutch version of Why Life Speeds Up As You Get Older has won several scientific and literary awards.</p><p>Where do the long, lazy summers of our childhood go?

This short introduction marries familiar everyday uses of the term with the more complex theoretical debates that have grown up around it. The text makes the debates intelligible to students, using illustrations from the news, popular culture, and everyday life as a way into more abstract ideas. It traces the development of the concept of place from the 1950s through its subsequent appropriation by cultural geography and the linking of place to politics. Substantial parts of exemplary papers by Doreen Massey and David Harvey are included as a focus for discussion, and the author also considers empirical examples of ways in which the concept of place has been mobilised in research. Teaching and learning aids include an annotated bibliography, lists of key readings and texts, a survey of web resources, and suggestions for pedagogical resources and student projects.<b>Tim Cresswell</b> is Professor in Social and Cultural Geography at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.

It created a national furor comparable only to the excitement stirred by the publication, in 1866, of Crime and Punishment. To Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov captured the quintessence of Russian character in all its exaltation, compassion, and profligacy. Significantly, the book was on Tolstoy's bedside table when he died. Readers in every language have since accepted Dostoevsky's own evaluation of this work and have gone further by proclaiming it one of the few great novels of all ages and countries.<br> "The Brothers Karamazov stands as the culmination of Dostoevsky's art--his last, longest, richest, and most capacious book," said The Washington Post Book World. <br> "Nothing is outside Dostoevsky's province," observed Virginia Woolf. "Out of Shakespeare there is no more exciting reading." <p><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, andtype, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p>The Modern Library of the World's<br>Best Books<br><br>"I am called a psychologist; it's not true.

Motels, home trailers, drive-ins, barbecues, beach life and surfing, sports from polo and tennis and golf to mountain climbing and skiing, "sportswear" (a word coined at the time), and sun suits were all a part of the good life--perhaps California's most distinctive influence of the 1930s. In <em>The Dream Endures</em>, Kevin Starr shows how the good life prospered in California--in pursuits such as film, fiction, leisure, and architecture--and helped to define American culture and society then and for years to come.<br>Starr previously chronicled how Californians absorbed the thousand natural shocks of the Great Depression--unemployment, strikes, Communist agitation, reactionary conspiracies--in <em>Endangered Dreams</em>, the fourth volume of his classic history of California. In <em>The Dream Endures</em>, Starr reveals the other side of the picture, examining the newly important places where the good life flourished, like Los Angeles (where Hollywood lived), Palm Springs (where Hollywood vacationed), San Diego (where the Navy went), the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (where Einstein went and changed his view of the universe), and college towns like Berkeley. We read about the rich urban life of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in newly important communities like Carmel and San Simeon, the home of William Randolph Hearst, where, each Thursday afternoon, automobiles packed with Hollywood celebrities would arrive from Southern California for the long weekend at Hearst Castle.<br>The 1930s were the heyday of the Hollywood studios, and Starr brilliantly captures Hollywood films and the society that surrounded the studios. Starr offers an astute discussion of the European refugees who arrived in Hollywood during the period: prominent European film actors and artists and the creative refugees who were drawn to Hollywood and Southern California in these years--Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Man Ray, Bertolt Brecht, Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Mann, and Franz Werfel. Starr gives a fascinating account of how many of them attempted to recreate their European world in California and how others, like Samuel Goldwyn, provided stories and dreams for their adopted nation. Starr reserves his greatest attention and most memorable writing for San Francisco. For Starr, despite the city's beauty and commercial importance, San Francisco's most important achievement was the sense of well-being it conferred on its citizens. It was a city that "magically belonged to everyone."<br>Whether discussing photographers like Edward Weston and Ansel Adams, "hard-boiled fiction" writers, or the new breed of female star--Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, Bette Davis, Carole Lombard, and the improbable Mae West--<em>The Dream Endures</em> is a brilliant social and cultural history--in many ways the most far-reaching and important of Starr's California books.<br></p><p>The late 1930s and early 1940s introduced to California culture some of the features that still characterize it today, at least in the view of outsiders to the Golden State: surfing, drive-in movie theaters, barbecues, motels, polo shirts, and recreational vehicles. The period brought equally enduring but less superficial changes, too: advances and setbacks alike in race relations, resource management, urban development, and transportation. Kevin Starr continues his multivolume history of California with this deeply learned, always fascinating account of California at the dawn of the modern age, with a cast of characters ranging from the Native American hermit Fig Tree John to violinist Yehudi Menuhin and hardboiled-fiction master Raymond Chandler.10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Billy Budd, Sailor and Other Uncompleted Writings: The Writings of Herman Melville, Volume 13 (Volume 13)</h2><p>The gripping tale of a handsome and charismatic young sailor who runs afoul of his ship&#x2019;s master-at-arms, is falsely accused of inciting a mutiny, and hung, <i>Billy Budd, Sailor </i>is often treated as a masterpiece, a canonical work. But that assessment is at least partly founded on the assumption that the story was complete and ready for publication when it was left among the manuscripts on Melville&#x2019;s writing desk when he died in 1891. As Hershel Parker has pointed out, &#x201c;It is a wonderfully teachable story&#x2014;as long as it is not taught as a finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art.&#x201d; Furthering Melville&#x2019;s goal of getting his last literary projects into print, even in their imperfect forms, this last volume in the edition presents the poetry and prose that Melville was unable to finish, his sometimes ineffectual, sometimes heroic purposes betrayed by death.<br><br> These unfinished writings include, besides <i>Billy Budd</i>, two projected volumes containing poems and prose pieces, <i>Weeds and Wildings</i> and <i>Parthenope</i>; three prose pieces, &#x201c;Rammon,&#x201d; &#x201c;Story of Daniel Orme,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Under the Rose&#x201d;; and some three dozen poems of varying lengths. Some of these pieces were surely composed late in Melville&#x2019;s career, during his retirement, but others may date to as early as the 1850s. Except for <i>Billy Budd</i>, many of these works have not been readily available in reliable texts, when available at all.<br><br> This volume, the result of the editors&#x2019; meticulous study of the manuscripts, offers new reading texts, with significant corrections of words, phrases, and titles, the inclusion of heretofore unpublished lines of verse, and the return to their original locations of the two poems, &#x201c;The Enviable Isles&#x201d; and &#x201c;Pausilippo,&#x201d; that Melville had extracted for use in <i>John Marr</i> (1888) and <i>Timoleon </i>(1891). Hershel Parker&#x2019;s Historical Note traces how these writings fit into the trajectory of Melville&#x2019;s career, and the rest of the Editorial Appendix presents the scholarly evidence and decisions made in creating the reading texts. As a whole, the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of <i>The Writings of Herman Melville</i>, now complete in fifteen volumes, offers for the first time the total body of Melville&#x2019;s extant writings in a critical text, faithful to his intentions.</p><p><b>HERMAN MELVILLE&nbsp;</b>(1819&#x2013;1891), the American novelist, reviewer, short-story writer, poet, and essayist, worked at various times as a teacher, sailor, farmer, and (for nineteen years) as a customs inspector. He died at seventy-two, in relative obscurity, still in the course of publishing his poetry in small, privately printed editions, and with <i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i> not yet completed.<br><br> &nbsp;"At his death, Melville&#x2019;s unpublished manuscripts were consigned to a metal breadbox, where they lay, undisturbed as the grave, for nearly thirty years. When the unassuming receptacle... was finally opened by the Melville biographer Raymond Weaver in 1919, just in time to help fuel the great Melville revival of the 1920s, it was found to contain a considerable amount of miscellaneous material, which Elizabeth Melville had painstakingly tied 'with pink tape into orderly bundles.' The contents of the bundles are now handsomely housed in the fifteenth and final volume of the majestic Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville&#x2019;s writings, a project begun in 1965 and completed to coincide with the bicentennial in 2019 of Melville&#x2019;s birth... The seventy-two pages of Billy Budd are unblemished by scholarly intrusion&#x2014;no brackets or footnotes or marginal codes... What follows this pristine presentation, however, is more than seven hundred pages of detailed commentary: a historical note by the leading Melville scholar Hershel Parker, a general statement on editorial procedure, and specific notes on every editorial decision, no matter how slight... <i>Billy Budd</i> has, over the years, attracted an extraordinary coterie of admirers." --<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Heinemann Book of Contemporary African Short Stories</h2><p><p>Capturing the diversity of African writing from across the continent, this important &nbsp;anthology draws together well-established authors and the best of new writers.<br> <br> </p> <p>From the harsh realities of South Africa, elegantly described by Nobel Prize winner Nadine Gordimer, to the fantastic world of Booker Prize winner Ben Okri and from the magic realism of Mozambican Mia Couto to the surreal world of Ghanaian Kojo Laing, the editors have distilled the essence of contemporary African writing. Blending the supernatural and the secular, the market-place and the shrine, this anthology gives the reader a taste of the full range of African literary styles.</p></p><p>Chinua Achebe was born in 1930 in the village of Ogidi in Eastern Nigeria. After studying medicine and literature at the University of Ibadan, he went to work for the Nigerian broadcasting company in Lagos. Things Fall Apart, his first novel was published in 1958. It sold over 2,000,000 copies, and has been translated into 30 languages. It was followed by No Longer at Ease, then Arrow of God (which won the first New Statesman Jock Campbell Prize), then A Man of the People (a novel dealing with post-independence Nigeria). Achebe has also written short stories and children&#39;s books, and Beware Soul Brother, a book of his poetry, won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize in 1972.Achebe has been at the Universities of Nigeria, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and among the many honours he has received are the award of a Fellowship of the Modern Language Association of America, and doctorates from the Universities of Stirling, Southampton and Kent. He followed Heinrich Boll, the Nobel prizewinner, as the second recipient of the Scottish Art&#39;s Council Neil Gunn Fellowship. In 1987, he was recognised in Nigeria with the Nigerian National Merit Award - the country&#39;s highest award for intellectual achievement.YA-- Gathered together are 20 short stories written between 1980-1991. They are divided by region: five stories from Southern Africa; two from Central Africa; five from East Africa; two from Northern Africa; and six from West Africa. Region is important for, in many cases, the issues of the area are reflected in the selections. As an example, those from South Africa use racism as a major theme. Several have strong maternal figures struggling to provide for their families under intolerable burdens. While many of the authors are new, there are some well-established names. Nadine Gordimer's ``Amnesty'' beautifully describes the harshness of life in South Africa. The writing is mature, and the themes and moods are many, ranging from mystical to magical to supernatural to realistic.

During the half century since Winterthur opened to the public, its staff has worked to compile comprehensive training materials for Winterthur interpreters, culminating in the Handbook for Winterthur Interpreters. Now, Winterthur educators Rosemary Krill and Pauline Eversmann have adapted that guide for general use. Early American Decorative Arts, 1620-1860: A Handbook for Interpreters is an indispensable guide for anyone involved with interpretation of decorative arts collections. Krill and Eversmann first define and elucidate the principles and goals of interpretation, explain how to look at objects, and help the reader to understand style. Then in later chapters they provide comprehensive descriptions and explanations of many items in styles ranging from seventeenth-century Mannerist to Empire, or Late Classical. Included are furniture, ceramics, textiles, paintings, pictures and prints, glass, pewter, and clocks, as well as other objects. Their interpretive approach situates each type and style within the social, economic, and cultural contexts of its time. More than 180 photographs drawn from the dazzling Winterthur collections help to illustrate details, and extensive bibliographies provide additional resources for further research and study. This book is an absolute must-have resource for curators, educators, interpreters, and students of decorative arts. Published in cooperation with Winterthur Museum, Garden &amp; Library</p><p>With <i>Early American Decorative Arts, 1620-1860: A Handbook for Interpreters</i>, authors Rosemary Troy Krill and Pauline K.

They date back more than 100 million years. Yet their story has never been fully told.In Feathers, biologist Thor Hanson details a sweeping natural history, as feathers have been used to fly, protect, attract, and adorn through time and place. Applying the research of paleontologists, ornithologists, biologists, engineers, and even art historians, Hanson asks: What are feathers? How did they evolve? What do they mean to us?Engineers call feathers the most efficient insulating material ever discovered, and they are at the root of biology&#39;s most enduring debate. They silence the flight of owls and keep penguins dry below the ice. They have decorated queens, jesters, and priests. And they have inked documents from the Constitution to the novels of Jane Austen.Feathers is a captivating and beautiful exploration of this most enchanting object.</p><p><b>Thor Hanson</b> is a conservation biologist, Switzer Environmental Fellow, and member of the Human Ecosystems Study Group.

Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, acclaimed for her many books on Jewish thought, turns her attention to Moses in this remarkably rich, evocative book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on a broad range of sources&#x2014;literary as well as psychoanalytic, a wealth of classical Jewish texts alongside George Eliot, W. G. Sebald, and Werner Herzog&#x2014;Zornberg offers a vivid and original portrait of the biblical Moses. Moses's vexing personality, his uncertain origins, and his turbulent relations with his own people are acutely explored by Zornberg, who sees this story, told and retold, as crucial not only to the biblical past but also to the future of Jewish history.<br><br><b>About Jewish Lives:&nbsp;</b><br><br> Jewish Lives is a prizewinning series of interpretative biography designed to explore the many facets of Jewish identity. Individual volumes illuminate the imprint of Jewish figures upon literature, religion, philosophy, politics, cultural and economic life, and the arts and sciences. Subjects are paired with authors to elicit lively, deeply informed books that explore the range and depth of the Jewish experience from antiquity to the present.<br><br> In 2014, the Jewish Book Council named Jewish Lives the winner of its Jewish Book of the Year Award, the first series ever to receive this award.<br><br><b>More praise for Jewish Lives:</b><br><br> "Excellent."&nbsp;&#x2013;New York Times<br><br> "Exemplary."&nbsp;&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br> "Distinguished."&nbsp;&#x2013;New Yorker<br><br> "Superb."&nbsp;&#x2013;The Guardian</p><p><b>Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg</b> lectures on the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic thought at academic, psychoanalytic, and Jewish educational institutions around the world. In 1995 she received the National Jewish Book Award for <i>Genesis: The Beginning of Desire</i>."A celebrated biblical scholar, keen on weaving together traditional Jewish exegesis, psychoanalysis and postmodern criticism, Zornberg always displays minute attention to the psychological subtext of the Scriptures. . . . Bringing together copious, diverse and sometimes dissonant references (spanning Hasidic masters, George Eliot, Zizek and Beckett, among others), Zornberg gives a new tour of the life of Moses."&#x2014;Clemence Boulouque, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><p>"In this exceptionally well-written book, which has the elegance of literature, Zornberg sidesteps the historical question. She treats Moses as a fictional character, not because she rejects his possible historicity but rather because she focuses on him as a personality. . . . The result is a thoughtful and highly literate read."&#x2014;Robert A. Segal, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p><br>"For those wishing to engage the legacy of Moses more deeply, this is a must-read."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)<br>"A rich, erudite study of <i>Moses.&nbsp;</i>. . . Readers are introduced to nuanced yet eye-opening new views and interpretations of otherwise familiar texts. . . . A meaty, worthwhile biography by a great interpreter of Jewish texts."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Review&nbsp;</i>(starred review)<br>"In <i>Moses: A Human Life</i>, Aviva Zornberg offers fresh insight into a familiar story, while reconciling us to our deepening awareness that so much remains unknown. . . . [Zornberg] is both reverential and iconoclastic in her approach to Moses&#x2019; inner life."&#x2014;Susan Reimer-Torn, <i>Jewish Week</i><br>"<i>Moses: A Human Life</i> challenges readers to see Moses in an original and thought-provoking way &#x2014; not as a leader or a prophet, but as a man whose disabilities and conflicts make him uniquely qualified to speak for God and to achieve God&#x2019;s purpose. . . . Zornberg illustrates a touching picture of a man whose speech is limited but reaches his people &#x2014; God&#x2019;s chosen people &#x2014; and others as well."&#x2014;Maron L. Waxman, <i>Jewish Book Council</i><br>"What Zornberg&#x2019;s method really does is meld an astute literary reading of the text with psychoanalytic insight. What results is immensely interesting and appealing, at times moving, even to a skeptic of the psychoanalytic worldview."&#x2014;<i>Lilith</i><br>"Zornberg has not only succeeded, but achieved the seemingly impossible: contributing a fresh and original interpretation to a figure pondered over for more than 2,500 years."&#x2014;Zach Rabiroff, <i>Open Letters Monthly</i><br>"Using various literary sources (such as Martin Buber, Sigmund Freud, George Elliot and Franz Kafka), biblical commentators (such as Rashi) and rabbinic and midrashic narratives, Zornberg shows us a multifaceted Moses: He is a man whose sense of identity is fraught with ambiguity and insecurity, and he is also a man worthy of leading a nation to greatness."&#x2014;Linda Tucker, <i>Moment</i><br>&#x201c;[<i>Moses</i>] is a study that brings this great biblical figure to life in a way that promises to make him more deeply meaningful for readers today.&#x201d;&#x2014;John R. Barker, <i>Bible Today</i><br>"Only Avivah Zornberg could tell the story of Moses in such a way as to situate him on the very cusp of the sacred and the human while showing how completely he participates in both. Only Zornberg has the prodigious scholarship to draw out from her sources the uniquely anguished and creative energy of Moses&#x2019; life. In doing so she makes a plea for a Jewish ethics grounded in the outsider, the one who stutters and falls, while at the same time returning Moses as a fully modern prophet to the modern world."&#x2014;Jacqueline Rose, author of&nbsp;<i>The Last Resistance </i>and <i>Women in Dark Times</i><br>"The author has perfected a distinctive approach to the biblical text that is both traditional and post-modern, playful and profound, imaginative but also truthful."&#x2014;Steven Weitzman, author of&nbsp;<i>Solomon: The Lure of Wisdom</i><br></p><h2>Passing (Modern Library)</h2><p>First published to critical acclaim in 1929, Passing firmly established Nella Larsen's prominence among women writers of the Harlem Renaissance. The Modern Library is proud to present Passing&#x2014;an electrifying story of two women who cross the color line in 1920s New York&#x2014;together with a new Introduction by the Obie Award- winning playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange.<br><br>Irene Redfield, the novel's protagonist, is a woman with an enviable life. She and her husband, Brian, a prominent physician, share a comfortable Harlem town house with their sons. Her work arranging charity balls that gather Harlem's elite creates a sense of purpose and respectability for Irene. But her hold on this world begins to slip the day she encounters Clare Kendry, a childhood friend with whom she had lost touch. Clare&#x2014;light-skinned, beautiful, and charming&#x2014;tells Irene how, after her father's death, she left behind the black neighborhood of her adolescence and began passing for white, hiding her true identity from everyone, including her racist husband. As Clare begins inserting herself into Irene's life, Irene is thrown into a panic, terrified of the consequences of Clare's dangerous behavior. And when Clare witnesses the vibrancy and energy of the community she left behind, her burning desire to come back threatens to shatter her careful deception.<br><br>Brilliantly plotted and elegantly written, Passing offers a gripping psychological portrait of emotional extremity. The New York Times Book Review called Larsen "adroit at tracing the involved processes of a mind divided against itself, that fights between the dictates of reason and desire." The Saturday Review of Literature said, "[Larsen] has produced a work so fine, sensitive, and distinguished that it rises above race categories and becomes that rare object, a good novel."<br></p><p>The heroine of <i>Passing</i> takes an elevator from the infernal August Chicago streets to the breezy rooftop of the heavenly Drayton Hotel, "wafted upward on a magic carpet to another world, pleasant, quiet, and strangely remote from the sizzling one that she had left below." Irene is black, but like her author, the Danish-African American Nella Larsen (a star of the 1920s to mid-1930s Harlem Renaissance and the first black woman to win a Guggenheim creative-writing award), she can "pass" in white society. Yet one woman in the tea room, "fair and golden, like a sunlit day," keeps staring at her, and eventually introduces herself as Irene's childhood friend Clare, who left their hometown 12 years before when her father died. Clare's father had been born "on the left hand"--he was the product of a legal marriage between a white man and a black woman and therefore cut off from his inheritance. So she was raised penniless by white racist relatives, and now she passes as white. Even Clare's violent white husband is in the dark about her past, though he teases her about her tan and affectionately calls her "Nig." He laughingly explains: "When we were first married, she was white as--as--well as white as a lily. But I declare she's getting darker and darker." As Larsen makes clear, <i>Passing</i> can also mean dying, and Clare is in peril of losing her identity and her life.<p> The tale is simple on the surface--a few adventures in Chicago and New York's high life, with lots of real people and race-mixing events described (explicated by Thadious M. Davis's helpful introduction and footnotes). But underneath, it seethes with rage, guilt, sex, and complex deceptions. Irene fears losing her black husband to Clare, who seems increasingly predatory. Or is this all in Irene's mind? And is everyone wearing a mask? Larsen's book is a scary hall of mirrors, a murder mystery that can't resolve itself. It sticks with you. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Nella Larsen</b> (1891-1964) was the author of two novels and several short stories.

Mitchell provided a brilliant synthesis of the interrelated ideas that hover around, and describe aspects of, the relational matrix of human experience.&nbsp; Relationality charts the emergence of the relational perspective in psychoanalysis by reviewing the contributions of Loewald, Fairbairn, Bowlby, and Sullivan, whose voices converge in apprehending the fundamental relationality of mind.&nbsp; Mitchell draws on the multiple dimensions of attachment, intersubjectivity, and systems theory in espousing a clinical approach equally notable for its responsiveness and <br>responsible restraint.&nbsp; Relationality "signals a new height in Mitchell's always illuminating writing" (Nancy Chodorow) and marks the "coming of age" of the relational perspective in psychoanalysis (Peter Fonagy).</p><p><p>&#x201c;This particular volume, like so much of Mitchell&#x2019;s work, is noteworthy for its sparkling originality and creativity.&nbsp; It is written with obvious care, great honesty, clarity, and structure. . .

Chodorow, Ph.D., Author, <em>The Power of Feelings</em></p> <p>"In this book the relational perspective 'comes of age.'&nbsp; Mitchell brings his supreme confidence in navigating psychoanalytic theories to bear on the evolution of the relational perspective.&nbsp; The relationality of mind is placed in the context of the psychoanalytic tradition and out of it evolves a highly satisfying and elegantly integrated approach tht is respectful of other traditions while casting them in a fresh light.&nbsp; The result is a compelling new psychoanalytic theory for he 21st Century.&nbsp; <em>Relationality</em> is a remarkable achievement of creative scholarship that should be read by every psychodynamic clinician concerned with human relatedness."</p> <p>- Peter Fonagy, Ph.D., Freud Memorial Professor of Psychoanalysis, University College London</p> <p>"Stephen Mitchell's writing is always a delight and an education. In <em>Relationality</em>, with his characteristic lucidity, Mitchell explores the multiple dimensions and nuances of relationality, attachment, intersubjectivity, and systems theory.&nbsp; He shows the voices of Loewald, Fairbairn, Bowlby, Winnicott, and Sullivan converge and can be interwoven.&nbsp; His masterful and creative close reading on Loewald makes him accessible in a brand new way and could even stand on its own.&nbsp; Complementing Mitchell's theoretical erudition is a clinical responsiveness equally notable for its responsible restraint.&nbsp; He provides clinical examples of how to make use of ourselves and our spontaneity with respect to thoughtfulness, and he does so without endorsing an 'anything goes' mentality.&nbsp; Mitchell does far more than illuminate theory; in fresh and delightful ways, with grace and compassion, he illuminates people.&nbsp; For any course on relational theory this gem of a book should be at the top of the reading list."</p> <p>- Susan Coates, Ph.D., Columbia Center for Psychoanalytic&nbsp;Training and Research&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Moving Out: A Family Guide to Residential Planning for Adults with Disabilities</h2><p>Finding the right residential situation for an adult child with an intellectual disability doesn't have to be overwhelming.

Making revolutionary arguments upon its first publication in 1953, The Natural Superiority of Women stands as one of the original feminist arguments against biological determinism. An iconoclast, Montagu wielded his encyclopedic knowledge of physical anthropology in critique of the conventional wisdom of women as the &#39;weaker sex,&#39; showing how women&#39;s biological, genetic, and physical makeup made her not only man&#39;s equal, but his superior. Also a humanist, Montagu points to the emotional and social qualities typically ascribed to and devalued in women as being key to just social life and relationships. Subsequent editions of this book have provided additional support for Montagu&#39;s arguments, examining both biological and social scientific data of the late 20th century. One of the most broadly renowned and read scholars of our century, Montagu brings out this fifth edition with up-to-date statistics and references. A lengthy foreword by Susan Sperling contextualizes the book within the intellectual histories of feminism and anthropology, noting the huge social and intellectual changes that are spanned in Montagu&#39;s life and writing. Montagu&#39;s foundational book is an important addition to the library of all gender scholars.</p><p>This 1999 fifth edition contains significant new material compared to the previous 1992 release, and includes Montagu's new preface, an insightful introduction by Susan Sperling which explains Montagu's ideas in the context of current feminist theory....The noble ideas in this work will provide insight, courage and inspiration. <i>The Natural Superiority of Women</i> will help every thinking man to better appreciate the true essence of women, and help every woman to gain the vision and confidence to fulfill herself, nurture her family, stand up for her rights and make the world a better--a more equal and a more loving--place to live. (Michael Pastore <i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>Reading this book is a journal of discovery as Montagu sheds light on so many myths and customs that societies take for granted, including women.

The wide-ranging introduction explores the implicit politics of the novel about the nature of conservatism and liberalism in all their facets; the "woman question"; autobiographical echoes; gambling; and the novel's interest in modernity and the United States. The book also includes an invaluable appendix that outlines the political context of the Palliser novels and establishes the internal chronology of the series, providing a unique understanding of the six books as a linked narrative. The editors also provide explanatory notes, and the preface provides both a compact biography of Anthony Trollope and a Chronology charts his life against the major historical events of the period.<br><strong></strong> About the Series: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Auden called him &#x201c;the poet of the ordinary&#x201d;.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Yet Trollope has brought much pleasure.&nbsp; He can still make us laugh and many of his characters - Mrs Proudie, Slope, Glencora and Plantagenet Palliser, Lizzie Eustace, Phineas Finn, Augustus Melmotte, Archdeacon Grantly &#x2013; still live, perhaps rivalled only among 19th century novelists by some creations of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.&nbsp; Then there&#x2019;s his evocation of a period in history.&nbsp; Plantagenet Palliser, the Duke of Omnium and the central figure in <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i>, seems what a Victorian Duke should be.&nbsp; Palliser&#x2019;s measured Whig creed and his unquestioned place at the top of society are quite different in atmosphere from the revolutions that exploded in the mid nineteenth century throughout continental Europe.&nbsp; His ideology favours gradualism and is pragmatic - or English.&nbsp; It is also, on the whole, successful.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope wished to avoid obscurity or abstract theory.&nbsp; He believed that &#x201c;of all the needs a book has, the chief need is that it be readable&#x201d; for &#x201c;the primary object of a novel is to please&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving life to his characters is one way that he does this, displaying them at length, as if to show life&#x2019;s <i>longueurs</i>, unrolling his plots slowly although he wrote at immense speed, scarcely revising at all.&nbsp; Trollope thought that anyone might be trained to be a novelist for it is a craft similar to carpentry, which shocked Henry James to whom the House of Fiction was a sacred place.&nbsp; He suggests in his <i>Autobiography</i> that foxhunting is a better, even more worthwhile, way of passing time, giving the impression that he flung his pen down on completion of his requisite number of daily words and leapt joyfully upon a waiting horse.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Of the many characters that he created, Trollope most valued Plantagenet Palliser, putting him alongside only the Reverend Josiah Crawley in the <i>Last Chronicle of Barset</i>.&nbsp; For his creator, Palliser stands &#x201c;firmly on the ground&#x201d;.&nbsp; As Duke of Omnium (since the death of his uncle in an earlier novel <i>Phineas Redux</i>) he dominates <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i>, not only by what he does but through the insoluble regret of his past.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> shows Trollope&#x2019;s effectiveness.&nbsp; It is not too long, has no sub-plots that drag or are too facetious such as the rivalry between the farmer Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield in <i>Can You Forgive Her?</i> or the romantic carousel of the Reverend Thomas Gibson, the French sisters and Dorothea Stanby in <i>He Knew He Was Right</i>.&nbsp; A late work, it was published in 1880, when Trollope had passed his time of greatest success and only two years before his death.&nbsp; By then, his books were appearing first in serial form in magazines, this one in <i>All The Year Round</i> from October 1879 until July 1880.&nbsp; Other titles considered for it were <i>Lord Silverbridge</i> (the name of the Duke&#x2019;s eldest son), <i>The Duke and His Children</i> or <i>The Ex-Prime Minister</i>.&nbsp; I think that he (or his publisher) made the right choice.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novel is the last in the series beginning with <i>Can You Forgive Her</i>? -&nbsp; published in 1865 (and Trollope&#x2019;s best seller) &#x2013; that features Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Glencora.&nbsp; The Pallisers ascend to high places, partly through birth, partly through merit.&nbsp; Palliser, after the death of his unmarried, uncle, becomes Duke of Omnium and, later, Prime Minister.&nbsp; Glencora is vastly rich in her own right.<br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser appears first in <i>A Small House at Allington</i>, published in 1864, as a minor character: an awkward young man of twenty five, staying at Courcy Castle, in a Trollopian setting of a grand house party, and fumbling towards a flirtation with the stupid, beautiful Lady Dumbello. &nbsp;One of the first things that we read him saying is a brusque protest against Lord De Courcy&#x2019;s unpleasant amusement at Lord De Guest&#x2019;s discomfiture on having been attacked by a bull; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything to laugh at.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here - in the challenge to his older host &#x2013; comes a flash of strength from someone who had not seemed capable of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Different from his rakish, spoilt uncle the old Duke of Omnium, whose vast possessions and houses he will inherit, Palliser dislikes the aristocratic pursuits of racing or field sports.&nbsp; He is bored by luxury and grandeur, preferring work, especially his scheme to introduce decimal coinage.&nbsp; Unusually for a politician, he is &#x201c;a man altogether without guile and entirely devoted to his country&#x201d;.&nbsp; Most important, &#x201c;no one could mistake him for other than a gentleman&#x201d;.&nbsp; He is also virtuous.&nbsp; Alongside the need to entertain, Trollope had views on what was a desirable life: &#x201c;I have ever thought of myself as a preacher of sermons,&#x201d; he writes in the <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser had become when young, and through family influence, what the novelist believed should be &#x201c;the highest object of every educated Englishmen&#x201d;: a Member of Parliament.&nbsp; Trollope saw the British parliament, presumably both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, as &#x201c;the greatest in the world&#x201d;, admiring its combination of fierce and competitive debate and restrained behaviour.&nbsp; &#x201c;There is nothing like it,&#x201d; he writes in <i>Phineas Finn</i>, the second novel in the Palliser series, or &#x201c;nothing as yet.&nbsp; Nowhere else is there the same good-humoured, affectionate, prize-fighting ferocity in politics....&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He knew, however (and had seen first-hand while trying to be elected as Member of Parliament for Beverly) that there was dishonesty in the political world, connived at by both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Phineas Finn</i> a Conservative candidate Browborough is charged with bribery and gets off very lightly, to the relief of the Conservatives and the Liberals.&nbsp; Reform was in the air but in the novel political hacks from both parties &#x2013; Roby and Rattler &#x2013; admit to each other that the old corrupt ways are still useful.&nbsp; In <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i>, Sir Timothy Beeswax represents the less admirable side of politics. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Trollope had failed at Beverly.&nbsp; However, he knew the House of Commons, often attending its debates and learning its procedures from politicians who wished to aid his writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; His success, a contrast to earlier unhappiness and failure, let him meet such people.&nbsp; He became a clubman, taking especial pleasure in the Garrick.&nbsp; He sat on committees, was editor of the <i>Cornhill</i> and <i>St Paul&#x2019;s</i> magazines and often dined out as well as entertaining at his house at Waltham in Essex.&nbsp; After his break-through book <i>Barchester Towers</i>, Trollope&#x2019;s fame and earnings grew fast.&nbsp; There are accounts in mid-Victorian diaries and letters of this jovial, large and loud man.<br>&nbsp;<br>The world of the Pallisers, with its country houses, wealth and power, clearly intrigued him.&nbsp; It is only part of the political and social life of his time: that of the upper and upper middle classes.&nbsp; As always in Trollope, it&#x2019;s the characters that matter.&nbsp; He declared that he lived with these so intensely that he could know how they might behave under almost any circumstance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I think that Plantagenet Palliser, Duke of Omnium, is a perfect gentleman,&#x201d; Trollope wrote in his <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; &#x201c;If he is not, then I am unable to describe a gentleman.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope liked his heroes either to be &#x2013; or to aspire to be &#x2013; gentlemen and usually gave them the means to achieve this.&nbsp; His own family, however, had been expelled from the condition which may have been why he put such a value on it.&nbsp; Related to a Lincolnshire baronet, Anthony&#x2019;s father had tried to maintain what must have seemed his natural place, becoming a barrister and sending his sons to the public schools of Harrow and Winchester, yet fell into debt, bad luck, anger, ill health and depression.&nbsp; This condemned Anthony to humiliation; his father could not always pay the school fees or give him as much pocket money as his school mates.&nbsp; The family lived in increasingly wretched circumstances and he was dragged further down by adolescent confusion and gaucheness, what he termed the state of a &#x201c;hobbledehoy&#x201d;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Could the bleak childhood have been exaggerated, perhaps to match Dickens&#x2019;s time in the blacking factory?&nbsp; His older brother Thomas&#x2019;s memories are not so dark.&nbsp; But the young Anthony may have had a worse time than Thomas for the family&#x2019;s poverty and debts came later with the complete failure of their father.&nbsp; Thomas was also their mother&#x2019;s favourite.&nbsp; It was Frances Trollope, author of <i>The Domestic Manners of the Americans</i> and other best sellers, who redeemed the family.&nbsp; Anthony remembered her getting up at 4 am to write at the kitchen table.&nbsp; Later, as if in part emulation, he would be called each day at 5.<br>&nbsp;<br>Patronage saved him; the Trollopes had a friend in the Post Office who secured the boy a job.&nbsp; Although a Liberal, he remained against competitive examinations for the Civil Service, partly perhaps because his poor educational attainments might have made him fail.&nbsp; &#x201c;There are places in life which can hardly be well filled except by gentlemen,&#x201d; he wrote in the <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; Competition throws these open to people of all types, perhaps thwarting men such as Plantagenet Palliser, Duke of Omnium, who are without ambition or guile.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trollope, like Palliser, was a Whig, or a Liberal with conservative leanings: a belief that for years had attracted aristocrats but came to have less meaning or possibility as the nineteenth century faded.&nbsp; <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> came out in 1880 when aristocratic power (or power of the great rural landlords) was waning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agriculture was in decline and new men, from manufacturing or finance, were in the ascendant, often becoming peers themselves; the franchise had already been extended in a series of reform acts.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were, however, still rich landowners with urban property or minerals such as coal or iron ore and certain families still had parliamentary seats where they still influenced the selection of a candidate.&nbsp; Also, the idea of the gentleman had stayed powerful, reflected in the revival of interest in medieval chivalry.<br>&nbsp;<br>But what is a gentleman?&nbsp; Trollope suggests that money and inheritance are not enough.&nbsp; In <i>A Small House at Allington</i>, Crosbie considers the ancient De Courcy family of Courcy Castle and the Hartletop family of Shropshire, measuring them against the Dales of Allington who are small squires.&nbsp; The De Courcys, he thinks, are arrogant, hollow, hard, soulless compared to the Dales.&nbsp; Yet their grandeur has conquered his reason; after all &#x201c;Satan knew that heaven was better than hell; but he found himself to be fitter for the latter place&#x201d;, for Crosbie is a villain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some twenty years later, Henry James wrote of the effect of such seductive powers on Hyacinth Robinson in <i>The Princess Casamassima</i> and Isabel Archer in <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children</i> also pitches an American girl, Isabel Boncassen, into this exotic and proudly unequal world. <br>&nbsp;<br>The chaotic and decadent De Courcys, with their vicious quarrels between father and son, are different from the Pallisers.&nbsp; The old Duke of Omnium is sensible in his discretion and good relations with Plantagenet Palliser, his heir.&nbsp; Although selfish and immoral, he is one version of a Duke, in his elegance, pleasures and mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time of his death, insouciance and style have made the old man strangely totemic, even (as Trollope writes) a &#x201c;necessary&#x201d;, figure.&nbsp; Doubt is expressed in the clubs as to whether the heir &#x2013; the irreproachable Palliser &#x2013; can match the old man.<br>&nbsp;<br>But perhaps a gentleman should not be too interesting or too stylish; clearly the old Duke, in spite of his grandeur, is not one.&nbsp; Trollope seems to have believed that gentlemen were more likely to be those who do not have great fortunes: perhaps squires such as the Dales or landowners based principally in the country for country houses were to him the most perfect expression of England.&nbsp; &#x201c;Visitors to England who have not sojourned at a country-house, whether it be squire&#x2019;s, parson&#x2019;s, or farmer&#x2019;s, have not seen the most English phase of the country,&#x201d; Trollope wrote.<br>&nbsp;<br>Palliser, although hugely rich, has complete integrity and scorn for material things.&nbsp; He has also pride and humility, works very hard, but is dull and literal minded, lacking in fantasy, almost a prig.&nbsp; Trollope, as if to balance these deficiencies, gives his &#x201c;Planty Pal&#x201d; a wife of a very different type.&nbsp; Lady Glencora has charm and social ease although she can be silly and rash.&nbsp; &#x201c;There was no woman then in London better able to talk to a dozen people on a dozen subjects,&#x201d; Trollope writes of her in <i>Phineas Finn</i>.&nbsp; The emotional gap between them is clear in Palliser&#x2019;s tentative words when, as a young Member of Parliament and heir to a fortune, he asks her to marry him: &#x201c;You have heard what our friends wish?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>There is ice in this arranged marriage.&nbsp; Early on, she almost leaves him and he has to break off from duties as Chancellor of the Exchequer to take her on a long journey to the continent, away from the infinitely more dashing Burgo Fitzgerald.&nbsp; Plantagenet and she learn to be friends, even to be almost in love, aided (for Glencora) by his success which brings her admiration and position.<br>&nbsp;<br>Six long novels chart the rise of the Pallisers, also encompassing much else, including the dramas of the adventuress Lizzie Eustace (in <i>The Eustace Diamonds</i>) and the romantic and political life of the charming Irishman Phineas Finn.&nbsp; These brought criticism that the author wrote too much and <i>The Prime Minister</i>, <i>The Duke&#x2019;s Children&#x2019;s</i>...</p><h2>Higher-Order Perl: Transforming Programs with Programs</h2><p>Most Perl programmers were originally trained as C and Unix programmers, so the Perl programs that they write bear a strong resemblance to C programs.

Jung, Volume 6) (Collected Works of C.G. Jung, 16)</h2><p><p>One of the most important of Jung's longer works, and probably the most famous of his books, <i>Psychological Types</i> appeared in German in 1921 after a "fallow period" of eight years during which Jung had published little. He called it "the fruit of nearly twenty years' work in the domain of practical psychology," and in his autobiography he wrote: "This work sprang originally from my need to define the ways in which my outlook differed from Freud's and Adler's. In attempting to answer this question, I came across the problem of types; for it is one's psychological type which from the outset determines and limits a person's judgment. My book, therefore, was an effort to deal with the relationship of the individual to the world, to people and things. It discussed the various aspects of consciousness, the various attitudes the conscious mind might take toward the world, and thus constitutes a psychology of consciousness regarded from what might be called a clinical angle."</p><br><p> In expounding his system of personality types Jung relied not so much on formal case data as on the countless impressions and experiences derived from the treatment of nervous illnesses, from intercourse with people of all social levels, "friend and foe alike," and from an analysis of his own psychological nature. The book is rich in material drawn from literature, aesthetics, religion, and philosophy. The extended chapters that give general descriptions of the types and definitions of Jung's principal psychological concepts are key documents in analytical psychology.</p></p><p>The book is rich in material drawn from literature, aesthetics, religion, and philosophy.

Under the author's direct supervision, each book now contains the revised, sometimes expanded versions of the previously published work, as well as lengthy new introductions. The series begins with <i>Over the Edge</i> (1970), a collection of short stories, and <i>An Edge in My Voice</i> (1985), a collection of essays. Both the stories and the essays are standard Ellison. In a word: brilliant. Ellison is one of the few writers on the planet whose own life is often more amazing than most of his fiction. Even though several of the stories are from the very beginning of the author's career, they are still quite effective. The essays (which first appeared in such diverse publications as <i>Future Life</i>, the <i>L.A. Weekly</i> and the <i>Comics Journal</i> in the early 1980s) speak of truths and lies as relevant today as they were then. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>This is the first installation of a planned 20-volume collection of Ellison's fiction and nonfiction. He is a unique writer in that although he's won every award the sf and fantasy worlds can bestow, he's equally well known for his strong and often humorous opinions on just about every subject imaginable. Whether you're interested in his fiction or his philosophies, Ellison delivers the goods every time.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Raise Your Game: High-Performance Secrets from the Best of the Best</h2><p><b>Performance coach Alan Stein Jr. shares the secret principles used by world-class performers that will help you improve your productivity and achieve higher levels of success.</b><b><br></b><b> </b>High achievers are at the top of their game because of the discipline they have during the unseen hours.

In this monumental work, Peter Lake reveals, more than any previous critic, the extent to which Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays speak to the depth and sophistication of Elizabethan political culture and the Elizabethan imagination. Lake reveals the complex ways in which Shakespeare&#x2019;s major plays engaged with the events of his day, particularly regarding the uncertain royal succession, theological and doctrinal debates, and virtue and <i>virt�</i> in politics. Through his plays, Lake demonstrates, Shakespeare was boldly in conversation with his audience about a range of contemporary issues. This remarkable literary and historical analysis pulls the curtain back on what Shakespeare was really telling his audience and what his plays tell us today about the times in which they were written.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter Lake</b> is university distinguished professor of history, professor of the history of Christianity, and Martha Rivers Ingram Chair of History at Vanderbilt University.

The text allows the student to experience the computer as a tool for expressing ideas, not as a frustrating set of mathematical obstacles. This goal is supported by the use of Scheme, a modern dialect of Lisp, designed to emphasize symbolic programming.</p></p><p>For anyone learning the Scheme programming language, the second edition of <i>Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science</i> provides a very digestible textbook-style introductory tutorial to this powerful and elegant language.<p> In the words of the authors, <i>Simply Scheme</i> is designed to be a "prequel" to another book, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>. This latter title has been a staple of introductory computer science courses for years, but it assumes a certain background. </p><p> <i>Simply Scheme</i> works hard to make the somewhat tricky ideas of Scheme accessible. This tutorial stresses small sections on key language features, from basic functions, variables, and onward to recursion and other functional programming concepts. While languages like C++ and Java use objects to model data, Scheme programmers break a problem down into functions. The art--and elegance--of problem solving in Scheme comes from applying recursion and other design concepts.</p><p> Longer code samples in the book include a tic-tac-toe game, examples that work with poker and bridge, and a working spreadsheet demo. Throughout, the book employs a friendly and jargon-free approach to programming. This book is as much about <i>thinking</i> like Scheme as it is about the basic nuts and bolts of the language. Sections on using software patterns in Scheme help bring this new edition up to date.</p><p> Though not often used in business, Scheme and its cousin Common Lisp (which the book describes in an appendix) are still favored by computer scientists, for example, in artificial intelligence research. <i>Simple Scheme</i> succeeds in making a difficult programming language both approachable and accessible. It's a valuable resource to any computer science student who is taking Scheme on for the first time. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Scheme language fundamentals, functions and higher-order functions, variables, lambda basics, recursion, abstraction, software patterns in Scheme, lists, trees, sequential programming, working with files, vectors, Common Lisp.</p>Brian Harvey is Lecturer in the Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>A Practical Guide to Ethics: Living and Leading with Integrity</h2><p><p>This essential new text is designed for courses in contemporary moral issues, applied ethics, and leadership. Emphasizing personal choice in the study of ethics, the authors take the reader on a journey of self-discovery rather than a mere academic survey of the field of ethics.</p> <p><em>A Practical Guide to Ethics: Living and Leading with Integrity</em> helps students develop their skills in ethical decision-making and put those decisions into effective practice. Its unique focus on leadership, especially the moral dimensions of understanding one's own values, teaches students to understand and, through dialog and negotiation, communicate their own beliefs as a step to building coalitions with those who may hold different views. It is also distinctive in combining ethical theory with both multicultural ethics (Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, feminism) and a practical orientation to moral decision-making and leadership.</p></p><p>"<i>A Practical Guide to Ethics</i> is precisely what it claims to be. Written with an eye to application, it discusses ethical decision-making procedures in a thorough and accessible way. One especially attractive feature of the book is that it not only emphasizes the ethical dimension of communication, it shows readers how to be effective, ethically responsible participants in the communicative process." --Daniel E. Wueste, Director, Robert J. Rutland Institute for Ethics, Clemson University; President, Society for Ethics Across the Curriculum<br><br>"All philosophers know the joy of theory. But to have any effect on improving the human condition, ethical theory must be brought into practice. Manning and Stroud do a wonderful job showing how ethical theory ought to be integrated to everyday life. <i>A Practical Guide to Ethics</i> outlines how the tools of philosophy can be used to address the moral quandaries of home, the workplace, and the public square as family members, colleagues, and citizens." --David R.

His teachers are two quite different men: Bruno Rontini, the saintly bookseller, who teaches him about things spiritual; and Uncle Eustace, who introduces him to life&#39;s profane pleasures. The novel that Aldous Huxley himself thought was his most successful at &#34;fusing idea with story, &#34; Time Must Have A Stop is part of Huxley&#39;s lifelong attempt to explore the dilemmas of twentieth-century man and to create characters who, though ill-equipped to solve the dilemmas, all go stumbling on in their painfully serious comedies (in this novel we have the dead atheist who returns in a seance to reveal what he has learned after death but is stuck with a second-rate medium who garbles his messages).</p><p>ALDOUS HUXLEY (18941963) was an English writer who spent the latter part of his life in the United States. Though best known for Brave New World, he also wrote countless works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and essays. A humanist, pacifist and satirist, he wrote novels and other works that functioned as critiques of social norms and ideals. Aldous Huxley is often considered a leader of modern thought and one of the most important literary and philosophical voices of the 20th century.&#x201c;The book is exciting because it is talented . . . an engagingly advanced accomplishment.&#x201d; (Thomas Mann)<br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant performance.&#x201d; (Edmund Wilson - The New Yorker)<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Time Must Have a Stop</em> exhibits Mr. Huxley's learning, his gift for limericks, an acute sense of the craft of poetry and a genuine power of modern poetic phrase, a flow of ribald expression and more than a feast of dark and desperate conclusions about sex.&#x201d; (Times Literary Supplement)<br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary erudition, nasty wit, nihilism . . . a prime performance.&#x201d; (Kirkus Reviews)</p><h2>Lemonade for Sale (MathStart 3)</h2><p><p>Four kids and their sidekick, Petey the Parrot, run a lemonade stand whose patrons include all kinds of wacky neighbors&#x2014;even a juggler.

Can a family&#x2032;s beliefs and values be used as a predictor of vulnerability to stress? And most importantly, can family stress be prevented? In this <b>Second Edition</b>, Pauline Boss continues to explore both the larger context surrounding families and stress and the inner context, which includes perceptions and meanings. The author emphasizes the need for a more general contextual model of family stress that may be applicable to a wider diversity of people and families as well as a wider variety of stresses and crises than other models. The goal is to provide a framework for students and professionals engaged in helping families learn how to manage their stress.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Pauline Boss, Ph.D.,</b> is Professor Emeritus, University of Minnesota; a Fellow in the National Council on Family Relations (NCFR), the American Psychological Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.

She is former president of NCFR and a family therapist in private practice. In 1988, Dr. Boss wrote the first edition of <i>Family Stress Management </i>with a subsequent edition in 2002. For the third edition, she invited Chalandra Bryant and Jay Mancini to be her co-authors. Each edition has considerably advanced the Contextual Model of Family Stress. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With groundbreaking work as scientist-practitioner, Dr. Boss is the principal theorist in the study of family stress from ambiguous loss, a term she coined. Since then, she has researched various types of ambiguous loss, summarizing her work in the widely acclaimed book, <i>Ambiguous Loss: Learning to Live with Unresolved Grief </i>(Harvard University Press, 1999). In addition, <i>Loss, Trauma, and Resilience</i> (Norton, 2006), presents six therapeutic guidelines for treatment when loss is complicated by ambiguity. These guidelines are based on her years of work with families of the physically missing during the Vietnam War, after 9/11, and in Kosovo, as well as in clinical work as a family therapist. For families, Dr. Boss wrote the book, <i>Loving Someone Who Has Dementia</i> (Jossey-Bass, 2011), which outlines strategies for managing the ongoing stress and grief while caring for someone who is both here and not here, physically present but psychologically absent.

Shocking and compelling, the photographs in this retrospective collection reach to the outer limits of human nature. 100 full-page reproductions, printed in four colors.</p><p>At the age of 6, Joel-Peter Witkin witnessed an automobile accident in which a little girl was decapitated, her head rolling to a stop at his feet. This experience may have had a bearing on his lifelong obsession with the macabre, but does little to prepare the viewer for his bizarre photographs of hermaphrodites and other human grotesqueries. Imagine the fruits of a collaboration between Diane Arbus and Federico Fellini that might be rejected for being a little too extreme. Imagine what Larry Flynt might publish for residents of the <i>Twilight Zone.</i> Two of the milder images: the disembodied, almost skeletal heads of two gnarled old men locked in an intimate kiss; and an obese woman in a cone-shaped mask, breast-feeding an eel.Best-known for his intricate tableaux blending the sublime and the grotesque, Witkin here presents both the early, relatively simple portraits, heavily marked and altered in processing, as well as the recent allegories, which could be called pristine but for their provocative content. This chronological presentation of more than 100 works from a 20-year period allows the reader both to survey the path of that evolution and to recognize the recurring subjects of his shifting style. The themes of heaven and hell, suffering, beauty, and motherhood are as constant as his portrayal of mutilated and malformed flesh, masks, and the thorns and grapes that refer to Christianity and pagan myth. Brought out to accompany a retrospective that opens next month at New York's Guggenheim Museum, this catalog also contains a comprehensive dissection of Witkin's work by the show's curator and publishes Witkin's 1976 manifesto, "Revolt Against the Mystical."

But I'm black coal and this compression is turning me into a diamond. And as much as I want to conform and just be like every other chunk of coal, I am cursed by my need for a life of meaning. I will walk or crawl through transformation. Because I want a life of diamonds.<br><br> Tama Kieves (journal entry)<br><br> Real change isn't about knowing the right actions to take. Because, really, we all know you should probably eat kale instead of a pail of Ben &amp; Jerry's Rocky Road. Real change comes from an emotional and spiritual readiness. It's about changing from the inside, becoming ready to take the steps that arise from our essence. It's only readiness that makes an action right.<br><br> Tama Kieves (journal entry)<br><br> Where do you crave certainty right now? This, my friend, is where you're growing wings. You are in transition, about to crack open into the next dimension of wonder in your life. I know because you're alive-and that is how life works.<br><br> As a life and career/success coach and workshop leader, I've worked intimately with thousands in transition. I've seen every kind of crossroads. And I've often seen this pattern. It's the insistence on how things are supposed to be that causes pain. You do not lack the right life right now. You do not lack your path or the absolute best circumstances. You lack awareness.<br><br> You are thriving just by being in the fray. Uncertainty is your superpower. It's oxygen. It's necessary. It shakes you awake. It breaks through the shield of habit and exposes you to new options, redemption, and growth. Change is how you discover that you are more than who you thought you were, as you move from one identity to the next. So, yes, awesome one, change, helplessness, frustration-all of it is how we bake this cake. And this is how every extraordinary life is supposed to go.<br><br> On a clear, bright, high-def day in July, my friend Grace and I walked across the Hudson River walkway in Poughkeepsie, New York. Grace had come with the idea to do a healing ritual. She is my energy-sensitive shaman friend, walking with white owls in one realm and copywriting for marketing executives in another. I love people who walk in multiple realms-and I suspect that you are one of those people. I believe we are the ones who will shift the world.<br><br> Grace was going through a divorce. This change was slicing her to the bone, forcing her to let go of a dream and an identity. She was dismantling shared finances, responsibilities, and real estate. And each time her husband, her once-gentle friend, screamed accusations or punched a wall, she felt her heart break again. Yet Grace was determined to thrive, no matter the circumstances.<br><br> At the time, I was feeling out of control with my business. I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a panic, worrying that I couldn't get everything done or that I wouldn't ever find the right people to help me, especially since I was now nuts and could offer them something like bubkes as a base salary.<br><br> Really, I just wanted to hand someone all of my problems like a bunch of grenades and run. Interviewing prospective hires was like dating, only worse because I might have to pay them, too. I was so overwhelmed that even taking steps to get out of the overwhelm produced more overwhelm. And underneath it all, I was grieving a loved one's health challenge.<br><br> In moments of stress that seemed unbearable, I found myself in a haggling mode with God or the Universe or any power on call that day: Take it all away. Take away the uncertainty, the pressure, make it all go away. Give me an answer. Just take care of it.<br><br> It was the prayer of the tired.<br><br> It was the prayer of someone who had forgotten that real peace of mind isn't something you can just pick up at ShopRite like toilet paper. It was the prayer of someone who just wanted this done already. I was frantic to be out of pain and I hadn't yet realized that pushing myself to be out of pain was causing even more pain. This is one of those mysterious ironies in life that involve something like acceptance, and I really hate that.<br><br> I wanted to be "there" already-somewhere it was all resolved and I was maybe just a tiny bit wealthy, famous, skinny, and adored and all of it was permanent and guaranteed, and no one I loved was ever going to die, and if possible there wasn't going to be climate change either, because I despise heat.<br><br> But, of course, life was asking me to be here. Be here in the middle. Because here is where the Milky Way is. Here is where the journey is. Here is where the answers are, and the big payoffs, every single one of them. Here. Not there. The Universe was answering my prayer. It was answering it with the circumstances that would catapult me into change.<br><br> Grace had brought with her a woven blue pouch. Within the pouch, there were a small smooth black stone and a small smooth white one. She had gotten this "kit" as a sort of fun personal divination tool long ago. You ask your question about the future, then pick a stone: White is yes; black is no.<br><br> She was going to toss the stones into the great beaming Hudson River from high on the bridge. "Good-bye black-and-white thinking," she said, referring to expectations, answers, the mad desire for control. She'd had enough of trying to make her situation just go away or tie it up in a bow. "I'm not looking for definitive answers now," she said. I felt this big space come over us. The truth always has this signature. "I'm done with trying to force solutions or breakthroughs as though I can," laughed my wise friend.<br><br> We're not looking for answers. We're looking for next steps.<br><br> "<br><br> "<br><br> "So, what are we looking for if not immediate resolution?" I asked her as the tiny pouch with the simple promises twirled its way off the bridge, getting smaller and smaller, finally splashing into the great river below.<br><br> The moment I asked the question, I knew the answer. "Next steps," I said. "We're not looking for answers. We're looking for next steps." As if on cue, a breeze rippled the river below. I felt as though a Silent Love nodded with approval.<br><br> When I coach clients professionally, I guide these brilliant souls, who are no longer looking to create a conventional life, to follow the bread crumbs along the trail. It's the only path I know to the beckoning "gingerbread house" of the new life, which may not even have a name or definition yet.<br><br> There are always bread crumbs. This change in our lives isn't just happening to us. It's happening for us. That is the bedrock premise of thriving. The caterpillar "dies" so that the butterfly can emerge. And just as in metamorphosis, there is instinctive intelligence that drives the change. Our new life is always conspiring with us, sending us signals and cues.<br><br> Sometimes the next step is not an action like going public with your company. Sometimes, it's letting go of an old, limiting belief. Or dying honorably to a time in your life that is passing. Or having that conversation you need to have or picking up that book you heard about. Sometimes it's the decision to frankly accept where you are, even though a part of you wants to win a Nobel Peace Prize already because, well, it would be nice to have something to tell your mother.<br><br> There is always a next step or focus.<br><br> This is how a time of transformation takes place. You are led. You do not lead. This is the free fall and the windfall of uncertainty. You can't plan an inspired life. You can't force genius. It doesn't play by your rules. You may feel anxious, even while you are safer than you've ever been. Yet radical creativity, burning love, alchemy, invention, and the blaze of the wild divine do not fit into ordinary methodology. An extraordinary life is, by definition, not ordinary.<br><br> You are walking into the grand unknown. It's scary because anything can happen. It's wonderful because, finally, anything can happen.<br><br> A life of intrepid original expression requires the willingness to be birthed from within. Buy a paint-by-number set and you are guaranteed to paint a simplistic replica, but never a work of art. True change does not happen through rote execution but through an awakening, a rearrangement of your understanding and abilities. Trust me, when it comes to your real life, your time on earth, you want the work of art. <br><br> The writer Ana�s Nin put it this way: "There are few human beings who receive the truth complete and staggering, by instant illumination. Most of them acquire it fragment by fragment, on a small scale, by successive developments, like a mosaic."<br><br> You might feel like you want to move faster than one fragment at a time. Good luck with that. Because groundbreaking, foundational changes do not happen in a rush. The 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, the healing program that has enabled millions to do "what they could not do," is based on this simple maxim: "One day at a time." There's reason for that. It works. A spiritual life is not one that is answered in the future. It's the life that takes place in the present, one day, one heartbeat, one filament or breakthrough at a time.<br><br> You don't need to figure out your whole life at once. You don't have to know what you're doing. You don't have to know how this will all unfold. You won't know, even if you think you do. But you can do what is yours to do in the moment.<br><br> Grace looked down at the river that had absorbed her symbolic offering. She said, "I am saying good-bye to the need for certainty instead of authenticity. I am letting go of the need to rush or know what I can't yet know." It was a lovely way to acknowledge that her life was a mess, that all our lives are a mess, a continuous lopsided tango with uncertainty dressed in tight pants and sparkles, impishly encouraging our hearts to beat faster. And that, at times, no matter how much you wish to be standing on solid ground, you are standing in the marshlands between the worlds, hoping like hell you find a clue.<br><br> I looked around us on this spectacular day, because somehow all of humanity seemed to be out on that bridge. A big man with a thousand tattoos loped along, listening to a motivational podcast, maybe on how to fix your Harley, or how to love your inner child. Thin, fit women ran by, controlling the calories they burned, controlling something in their lives. A shiny dark-skinned woman who looked older than the river itself smiled among wrinkles as she leaned on a cane.<br><br> How many of those who passed by secretly worried about a lump they'd discovered? How many knew their lover was drinking again? How many needed to get more clients? How many even feared the promotion or dream project they'd just gotten, wondering if they could pull it off? How many felt lost, as though they didn't even know what they were here for anymore or how to get through the hours?<br><br> I smiled inside and thought of the prayer said in yoga classes, "Namaste," the light in me salutes the light in you. I knew we were all made of infinite strength and possibility, even while we felt like we were being jostled in the ocean like seaweed. Our uncertainty made us feel alone. But, actually, it's the one thing we all have in common. Everyone everywhere is dealing with a change in their lives.<br><br> Grace and I walked off that bridge feeling brighter. We'd eased some of our pain just by making the decision to stop trying to force the path to freedom to fit into something it would never be. It was okay to feel uncertain and still move forward. "I guess I'm just running a marathon," said Grace. "All I know is that I need to breathe deeply and keep hydrated." It seemed so simple. One damn step at a time.<br><br> I felt safer again, too, ironically, the more I committed to journeying into the unknown. It felt good to work with truth on truth's wide-open terms. "We just did something really big," said Grace. "Yes, we did," I said, already feeling myself settle down. I felt a connection to Grace, to myself, to life, to everyone on that bridge, and to everyone who would yet be on the bridge of life-and to you-crossing from one solid place to another.<br><br> Turning Points: How to Move Forward in an Uncertain Life<br><br> It's the insistence on how things are supposed to be that causes pain.<br><br> You do not lack the right life right now. You do not lack your path or the absolute best circumstances. You lack awareness.<br><br> Change is how you discover that you are more than who you thought you were, as you move from one identity to the next.<br><br> This change in our lives isn't just happening to us. It's happening for us.<br><br> We're not looking for answers. We're looking for next steps.<br><br> You are led. You do not lead.

It's scary because anything can happen. It's wonderful because, finally, anything can happen.<br><br> Any Choice Is a Risk, Except the Right One<br><br> Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative is the place where no one else has ever been.<br><br> Alan Alda<br><br> When you're scared, it's natural to want to get to safety. But keep in mind there is a kind of "safety" that is not safe. There is no safety in denying who you are.<br><br> Tama Kieves (journal entry)<br><br> It's human nature to want to experience the security of having everything under control. It may also be human nature to want to eat a feedbox of chocolate Easter bunnies, so there you have it.<br><br> Psychological studies show that we as human beings thrive on "positive stress." You think you want ironclad safety. But you deserve so much more in life than this-because the need for constant control can cause boredom, exhaustion, and hollowness. Like you didn't already know that.<br><br> Your spirit craves growth, and growth comes from taking risks. The right risk will offer you more security than holding on to "the devil you know." Because if that devil you know is draining the love out of you, you will meet a devil you don't want to know.</p><h2>Grant Writing For Dummies</h2><p>Are you writing a grant application for the first time?

They describe how Deaf culture and art thrived in mid-twentieth century Deaf clubs and Deaf theatre, and profile controversial contemporary technologies. </p><p> Most triumphant is the story of the survival of the rich and complex language American Sign Language, long misunderstood but finally recently recognized by a hearing world that could not conceive of language in a form other than speech. In a moving conclusion, the authors describe their own very different pathways into the Deaf community, and reveal the confidence and anxiety of the people of this tenuous community as it faces the future. </p><p> <i>Inside Deaf Culture</i> celebrates the experience of a minority culture--its common past, present debates, and promise for the future. From these pages emerge clear and bold voices, speaking out from inside this once silenced community. </p></p><p><b>Carol Padden</b> is a Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of California, San Diego.This well-organized and clearly written book provides a fascinating inside look at the development of Deaf culture...Padden and Humphries's presentation of these marvelous insights into the history and development of the language and beliefs of the Deaf should be viewed as a welcome step in the quest to inform the hearing world of the rich and fertile culture of the authors' beloved community.

But how did the funeral home come to hold such a position? What is its history? And is it guilty of the charges sometimes leveled against it? <br> In <em>Rest in Peace</em>, Gary Laderman traces the origins of American funeral rituals, from the evolution of embalming techniques during and after the Civil War and the shift from home funerals to funeral homes at the turn of the century, to the increasing subordination of priests, ministers, and other religious figures to the funeral director throughout the twentieth century. In doing so he shows that far from manipulating vulnerable mourners, as Jessica Mitford claimed in her best-selling <em>The American Way of Death</em> (1963), funeral directors are highly respected figures whose services reflect the community's deepest needs and wishes. Indeed, Laderman shows that funeral directors generally give the people what they want when it is time to bury our dead. He reveals, for example, that the open casket, often criticized as barbaric, provides a deeply meaningful moment for friends and family who must say goodbye to their loved one. But he also shows how the dead often come back to life in the popular imagination to disturb the peace of the living.<br> Drawing upon interviews with funeral directors, major historical events like the funerals of John F. Kennedy and Rudolf Valentino, films, television, newspaper reports, proposals for funeral reform, and other primary sources, <em>Rest in Peace</em> cuts through the rhetoric to show us the reality--and the real cultural value--of the American funeral.</p><p><br><strong>Gary Laderman</strong> is Associate Professor of American Religious History and Culture at Emory University and the author of <em>The Sacred Remains: American Attitudes Toward Death, 1799-1883</em>. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.<br><br>"A thoughtful consideration of an industry that is as misunderstood as it is necessary."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"To a subject accustomed to the cheap shot and sucker-punch, Laderman has brought a robust and welcome scholarship. Part cultural and professional history, part market study, part meditation on mortality, this necessary and eminently readable text examines the borders between the living and the dead in the tradition of Habenstein &amp; Lamers. Required reading for the professional and for the permanently curious."--Thomas Lynch, author of <em>The Undertaking: Life Studies from the Dismal Trade</em><p></p><br>"Where Mitford relied on muckrake and polemic, driven by opinion and a hunger for social change, Laderman is driven by a free-ranging intellectual curiosity and relies on the professorial tools of research and interview, review and analysis. History and philosophy, radio and TV, the daily papers and current cinema, Hollywood, holy writ, wrestling, Web sites and rock 'n' roll all have something to tell him about the way we look at mortality and matters mortuary. If Mitford's book was a best seller, Laderman's gives us a better record: comprehensive, intelligent and deeply insightful."--<em>Los</em> <em>Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Laderman provides fascinating insight into the embalming of the dead, which at the turn of the century was carried out in the home of the deceased by an undertaker who arrived carrying a bag of specialized instruments and chemicals needed to do his work.... His account of the preparation of John F. Kennedy's body after his assassination in Dallas and the open-casket debate is fascinating."--<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"In 1963, Jessica Mitford's <em>The American Way of Death</em> shocked the nation and provoked scandal throughout the funeral industry.... Forty years later, Laderman comes to the industry's defense with this thoughtful book. His case is cautious and honest. He presents the industry's history from its inception during the Civil War period up to the present.... [Laderman] provides convincing evidence that the industry is a necessary and compassionate force in American life. While critics like Mitford paint a picture of greed, this accounts offers a more nuanced image: an industry that provides a 'meaningful and material order out of the chaos of death."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A riveting account of death in twentieth-century America, <em>Rest in Peace</em> buries decades of stereotypes about Americans as death deniers and funeral directors as con men. Instead of skewering the 'Dismal Traders,' Laderman brings them to life, focusing on their postmortem work as an important form of culture charged with spiritual import and mythic significance. The book ranges widely, from the funeral of President Kennedy to the AIDS epidemic, from Disney's Fantasia to the World Wrestling Federation phenom The Undertaker. This is a superb cultural history filled with insights into America's many ways of death."--Stephen R. Prothero, author of <em>Purified by Fire: A History of Cremation in America</em><p></p><br>"Laderman sharply disputes the thesis of Jessica Mitford's influential 1963 expose, <em>The American Way of Death</em>.... Along the way, he provides fascinating details about how modern morticians have handled deaths in the limelight (JFK) and about how funeral directors have changed their methods in response to muckraking accusations (including Mitford's) and to shifting cultural attitudes toward death.... Laderman piquantly illustrates these recent trends by recounting the highly unconventional funeral of--it had to be--Jessica Mitford."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Soldiers of Evil: The Commandants of the Nazi Concentration Camps (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Uses interviews and personnel files in an attempt to understand the commandants and members of the SS who oversaw the Nazi concentration camps and tries to explain their participation in the Holocaust</p><p>Text: English, Hebrew (translation)Segev attempts to bring into focus the men who in WW II "consented to making terror their profession," and show how they implemented the murder of Jews into their daily routine. The attempt does not succeed, partly because, as the author himself notes, his subjects are "mediocre, shallow people without imagination, courage or initiative." His interviews with three former concentration camp commandants are unmemorable except for the moment when one breaks into sobs in self-pity over his postwar years in an Allied prison. The author's interviews with widows and children of former commandants are even less revealingmany tell him basically the same thing: there was no such thing as the Holocaust, and my husband (or father) was certainly not a party to it. The book, however, contains interesting material from the Berlin Documentary Center: details of recruitment, indoctrination and training of SS officers (the commandants were all members of Himmler's army-within-an-army) including official texts from a program designed to strengthen anti-Semitic consciousness.

Renowned author and critic Arthur C. Danto addresses this fundamental, complex question. Part philosophical monograph and part memoiristic meditation, <i>What Art Is </i>challenges the popular interpretation that art is an indefinable concept, instead bringing to light the properties that constitute universal meaning. Danto argues that despite varied approaches, a work of art is always defined by two essential criteria: meaning and embodiment, as well as one additional criterion contributed by the viewer: interpretation. Danto crafts his argument in an accessible manner that engages with both philosophy and art across genres and eras, beginning with Plato&#x2019;s definition of art in <i>The Republic</i>, and continuing through the progress of art as a series of discoveries, including such innovations as perspective, chiaroscuro, and physiognomy. Danto concludes with a fascinating discussion of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s famous shipping cartons, which are visually indistinguishable from the everyday objects they represent.</p><p>Throughout, Danto considers the contributions of philosophers including Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, and artists from Michelangelo and Poussin to Duchamp and Warhol, in this far-reaching examination of the interconnectivity and universality of aesthetic production.</p></p><p><b>Arthur C. Danto </b>was Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>.&#x201c;Danto is an elegant and erudite writer, and his sentences go down smoothly.&#x201d;&#x2014;Deborah Solomon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i> (Deborah Solomon <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Elaborating important themes of Danto&#x2019;s influential aesthetics,<i> What Art Is</i> develops them in fascinating new ways, offering luminous interpretations of past masters ranging from Michelangelo and Poussin to Duchamp and Warhol. Written in Danto&#x2019;s engagingly personal voice, the book&#x2019;s essays sparkle with wit, erudition, sensitivity, and a profound love of art whose power is captivatingly contagious.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Shusterman, author of&nbsp;<i>Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics</i> (Richard Shusterman)<br><br>&#x201c;This miraculously economical book summarizes many decades of reflection and provides an ideal entry into the philosophical system of the most important American-born writer who has discussed visual art.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Carrier, author of <i>Proust/Warhol: Analytical Philosophy of Art</i> (David Carrier)<br><br>&#x201c;Danto was and remains the high priest of pluralism, and arch-critic of the view that art has a distinctive essence.&#x201d;&#x2014;A.

G. Wells</b> was born Herbert George in Bromley, Kent, England, on September 21, 1866. His father was a professional cricketer and sometimes shopkeeper, his mother a former lady's maid. Although "Bertie" left school at fourteen to become a draper's apprentice (a life he detested), he later won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London, where he studied with the famous Thomas Henry Huxley. He began to sell articles and short stories regularly in 1893. In 1895, his immediately successful novel rescued him from a life of penury on a schoolteacher's salary. His other "scientific romances"&#x2014;<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i>&nbsp;(1896),&nbsp;<i>The Invisible Man&nbsp;</i>(1897),&nbsp;<i>The War of the Worlds&nbsp;</i>(1898),&nbsp;<i>The First Men in the Moon</i>&nbsp;(1901), and&nbsp;<i>The War in the Air&nbsp;</i>(1908)&#x2014;won him the distinction as the father of science fiction. Henry James saw in Wells the most gifted writer of the age, but Wells, having coined the phrase "the war that will end war" to describe World War I, became increasingly disillusioned and focused his attention on educating mankind with his bestselling&nbsp;<i>Outline of History</i>&nbsp;(1920) and his later utopian works. Living until 1946, Wells witnessed a world more terrible than any of his imaginative visions, and he bitterly observed: "Reality has taken a leaf from my book and set itself to supercede me."</p><h2>En Avant: Beginning French</h2><p>Your students are changing.

How the Court sets its agenda, therefore, is perhaps as important as how it decides cases. H. W.

He conveys a wealth of new information in clear prose and integrates insights he gathered in unprecedented interviews with five justices. For this unique study Perry also interviewed four U.S. solicitors general, several deputy solicitors general, seven judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and sixty-four former Supreme Court law clerks.</p><p>The clerks and justices spoke frankly with Perry, and his skillful analysis of their responses is the mainspring of this book. His engaging report demystifies the Court, bringing it vividly to life for general readers&#x2015;as well as political scientists and a wide spectrum of readers throughout the legal profession. Perry not only provides previously unpublished information on how the Court operates but also gives us a new way of thinking about the institution. Among his contributions is a decision-making model that is more convincing and persuasive than the standard model for explaining judicial behavior.</p></p><p>In this unique study, H. W.

Although it is intended for the nonspecialist, students of Romance philology will find it useful as a ready reference and as a source of abundant examples of Latin sound changes.<br><br>The synopsis is presented in the form of separate alphabetical charts for each major sound change. The rules, stated as simply as possible, do not generally explain the evolution of the changes, but only the end results. For those desiring further information, there are notes after most rules outlining exceptions to or modifications of that rule and often sketching successive stages in the development of the sound. Several minor or sporadic sound changes are also treated in note form. Each chart is supplemented by a list of additional words illustrating the same sound change.<br><br><i>From Latin to Roman in Sound Charts</i> has been used successfully as a graduate level text for such courses as History of Spanish, History of French, and Romance Linguistics.</p><p></p><h2>No Future for You: Salvos from The Baffler (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A new collection on carnival hokum and magical thinking in post-apocalypse America&#x2015;brought to you by The Baffler.</b></p><p>There's never been a better time to be outside the consensus&#x2015;and if you don't believe it, then peer into these genre-defining essays from <i>The Baffler</i>, the magazine that's been blunting the cutting edge of American culture and politics for a quarter of a century. Here's Thomas Frank on the upward-falling cult of expertise in Washington, D.C., where belonging means getting the major events of our era wrong. Here's Rick Perlstein on direct mail scams, multilevel marketing, and the roots of right-wing lying. Here's John Summers on the illiberal uses of innovation in liberal Cambridge, Massachusetts. And here's David Graeber sensing our disappointment in new technology. (We expected teleportation pods, antigravity sleds, and immortality drugs. We got LinkedIn, which, as Ann Friedman writes here, is an Escher staircase masquerading as a career ladder.) </p><p>Packed with hilarious, scabrous, up to-the-minute criticism of the American comedy, <i>No Future for You</i> debunks &#x201c;positive thinking&#x201d; bromides and business idols. Susan Faludi debunks Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg's phony feminist handbook, Lean In. Evgeny Morozov wrestles &#x201c;open source&#x201d; and &#x201c;Web 2.0&#x201d; and other pseudorevolutionary meme-making down to the ground. Chris Lehmann writes the obituary of the Washington Post, Barbara Ehrenreich goes searching for the ungood God in Ridley Scott's film <i>Prometheus</i>, Heather Havrilesky reads <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>, and Jim Newell investigates the strange and typical case of Adam Wheeler, the student fraud who fooled Harvard and, unlike the real culprits, went to jail.</p><p><i>No Future for You</i> offers the counternarrative you've been missing, proof that dissent is alive and well in America.

While at work on this book, the two also conceived another less well-known but equally important book project entitled <i>Many Are Called</i>.<i> </i>This three-year photographic study of subway passengers made with a hidden camera was first published in 1966, with an introduction written by Agee in 1940. Long out of print<i>, Many Are Called </i>is<i> </i>now being reissued with a new foreword and afterword and with exquisitely reproduced images from newly prepared digital scans.</p><p><i>Many Are Called </i>came<i> </i>to fruition at a slow pace. In 1938, Walker Evans began surreptitiously photographing people on the New York City subway. With his camera hidden in his coat the lens peeking through a buttonhole he captured the faces of riders hurtling through the dark tunnels, wrapped in their own private thoughts. By 1940-41, Evans had made over six hundred photographs and had begun to edit the series. The book remained unpublished until 1966 when The Museum of Modern Art mounted an exhibition of Evans&#x2019;s subway portraits.</p><p>This beautiful new edition published in the centenary year of the NYC subway is an essential book for all admirers of Evans&#x2019;s unparalleled photographs, Agee&#x2019;s elegant prose, and the great City of New York.</p></p><p><p>Luc Sante, author of <i>Low Life, Evidence, </i>and <i>The Factory of Facts, </i>is Visiting Professor of Writing and the History of Photography at Bard College; Jeff L. Rosenheim, Associate Curator, Department of Photographs, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the editor of <i>Unclassified: A Walker Evans Anthology </i>and<i> Walker Evans: Polaroids </i>and<i> </i>was the main contributor to the Metropolitan&#x2019;s exhibition catalogue <i>Walker Evans </i>(2000).</p>&#x201c;Finally, today we have a re-issue of Many Are Called. It is truly a labor of love. This book is true to the look, feel, and spirit of the original. It does have a different cover, but includes a photograph of the original cover for reference. Two new texts have been added to the book. Luc Sante, the excellent writer and interpreter of photography, writes the foreword, while Jeffrey Rosenheim, the steward of this project, writes a historical sketch as an afterword. The pictures are reproduced in the same sequence as the original, and the reproductions, varnished duotones, rival the quality of the silver gelatin originals. Each plate is keyed to its date and Metropolitan Museum of Art accession number. The reproductions and the book itself are slightly enlarged in comparison with the first edition. Many Are Called has been issued only in hardcover. It is one of the more important books of the 20th century.&#x201d;&#x2014;photo-eye<br><br><br>&#x201c;Yale University Press&#x2019;s reissue of the book, along with its original poetic introduction by James Agee, represents the first proper introduction of Evans&#x2019;s subway work to a broad audience and a full reintegraton of the photos into the arc of his career. It is hard to imagine a better way to celebrate the subway&#x2019;s centennial or to reconsider Evans, one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most influential photographers and artists.&#x201d;&#x2014;Randy Kennedy, New York Times Book Review<br></p><h2>Discover Sociology</h2><p><p>With their newest edition, Bill Chambliss and Daina S. Eglitis continue the journey beyond the classroom to help students answer these questions in <strong>Discover Sociology</strong>. Chambliss and Eglitis inspire curiosity about the social world and empower students by providing the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools they need to understand, analyze, and even change the world in which they live. Every chapter in the book integrates robust pedagogical features and empirical research that illuminate the social roots of diverse phenomena and institutions, ranging from poverty and deviance to capitalism and the nuclear family. From exploring whether the use of "study drugs" should be considered cheating to an examination of research showing a correlation between rising student debt and declining rates of marriage, the book&#x2019;s chapter openers engage students in real-life applications of sociology. Going beyond theory and concepts, the authors also help answer the question, "What can I do with a sociology degree?"&nbsp; </p></p><p><p>William J. Chambliss, professor of sociology at The George Washington University, was a critical sociological theorist whose research has ranged broadly from studies of law creation and the legal system to participant observation studies of juvenile gangs, organized crime, policing, and the impact of social movements on political and economic change. He served as president of the American Society of Criminology and the Society for the Study of Social Problems. He has received numerous awards for his research and teaching, including the prestigious Edwin H. Sutherland Award from the American Society of Criminology, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association, the Bruce Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, the PASS Award from the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sociology of Law Section of the American Sociological Association. He has authored and edited over 35 books in sociology, criminology and criminal justice and numerous articles in social science journals.</p>"The single best thing about the textbook is how it balances being attractive and accessible for student readers, and being well-organized and strong content-wise to meet my expectations as an instructor."<br> (Matthew Green 2015-11-01)<br><br>"There is good linkage between theory and the discussions.&nbsp; The vignettes on what one can do with a sociology degree tying specific topics to the skills desired in different areas, is unique."<br> (Othello Harris 2015-11-01)<br><br>"The combination of the content covered, the level of difficulty, design, and the quality of the supplemental materials was winning.

This is important because students regularly complain about having to memorize names.&nbsp; Asking them instead to focus on how a paradigm (e.g. structural functionalism) would explain something [like gender inequality] is much more helpful."</p> (Robert S.

The Suzuki Method(R) of Talent Education is based on Shinichi Suzuki's view that every child is born with ability, and that people are the product of their environment. According to Shinichi Suzuki, a world-renowned violinist and teacher, the greatest joy an adult can know comes from developing a child's potential so he/she can express all that is harmonious and best in human beings. Students are taught using the "mother-tongue" approach. Each series of books for a particular instrument in the Suzuki Method is considered a Suzuki music school, such as the Suzuki Cello School. Suzuki lessons are generally given in a private studio setting with additional group lessons. The student listens to the recordings and works with their Suzuki cello teacher to develop their potential as a musician and as a person. This performance/accompaniment CD of the Suzuki cello method for Volumes 1 and 2 feature recordings by world-renowned cellist Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi, and piano accompaniments recorded with the cello part as well as piano accompaniments recorded alone. <br><br>Titles: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star Variations (Suzuki) * French Folk Song (Folk Song) * Lightly Row (Folk Song) * Song of the Wind (Folk Song) * Go Tell Aunt Rhody (Folk Song) * O Come, Little Children (Folk Song) * May Song (Folk Song) * Allegro (Suzuki) * Perpetual Motion in D Major (Suzuki) * Perpetual Motion in G Major (Suzuki) * Long, Long Ago (Bayly) * Allegretto (Suzuki) * Andantino (Suzuki) * Rigadoon (Purcell) * Etude (Suzuki) * The Happy Farmer from Album for the Young, Op. 68, No. 10 (Schumann) * Minuet in C, No. 11 in G Major from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, BWV 841 (Bach) * Minuet No. 2 from Minuet in G Major, BWV 116 (Bach), Long, Long Ago (Bayly) * May Time, Komm Lieber Mai (Longing for Spring) from Sehnsucht nach dem Fr�hlinge, K. 96 (Mozart) * Minuet No. 1, Minuett III from Suite in G Minor for Klavier, BWV 822 (Bach</p><p></p><h2>A World History of Photography</h2><p>Traces photographic history both topically and chronologically, profiles key masters, explains terms and processes, and features the landmarks in the development of photography.</p><p>From the camera lucida to the latest in digital image making and computer manipulation, photographic technology has dramatically changed throughout its nearly 200-year history, as succinctly explained and powerfully illustrated in A World History of Photography. Thanks to the unique immediacy with which photography captures perspective and history, the popularity and use of the camera spread rapidly around the globe. Today, photography is ubiquitous: from newspapers and fashion magazines to billboards and the film industry, cultures worldwide have embraced this malleable artistic medium for a limitless variety of purposes. <p> </p><p>Naomi Rosenblum's classic text investigates all aspects of photography--aesthetic, documentary, commercial, and technical--while placing photos in their historical context. Included among the more than 800 photographs by men and women are both little-known and celebrated masterpieces, arranged in stimulating juxtapositions that illuminate their visual power. Authoritative and unbiased, Rosenblum's chronicle of photography both chronologically and thematically traces the evolution of this still-young art form. Exploring the diverse roles that photography has played in the communication of ideas, Rosenblum devotes special attention to topics such as portraiture, documentation, advertising, and photojournalism, and to the camera as a means of personal artistic expression. The revised fourth edition includes updates on technical advances as well as a new chapter on contemporary photographers.

The movement&#x2019;s emphasis on aesthetic quality and a high level of craftsmanship, promoted as an antidote to the ubiquity and uninspired appearance of machine-produced products, remains much admired today. Arts and Crafts enjoyed special resonance in Chicago, the home of Jane Addams&#x2019;s Hull House, where immigrants and women received training in handicraft skills not only to beautify domestic life but also to provide them with viable, honorable work.</p><p><i></i>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Apostles of Beauty </i>presents outstanding examples by the movement&#x2019;s British originators, such as William Morris and Charles Robert Ashbee, as well as its greatest American practitioners, such as Gustav Stickley and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Stoically poised for battle in the spring of 1945&#x2015;when even Japan&#x2019;s last desperate technique of arms, the <em>kamikaze</em>, was running short&#x2015;<em>Yamato</em> arose as the last magnificent arrow in the imperial quiver of Emperor Hirohito. Here, Jan Morris not only tells the dramatic story of the magnificent ship itself&#x2015;from secret wartime launch to futile sacrifice at Okinawa&#x2015;but, more fundamentally, interprets the ship as an allegorical figure of war itself, in its splendor and its squalor, its heroism and its waste. Drawing on rich naval history and rhapsodic metaphors from international music and art, <em>Battleship Yamato</em> is a work of grand ironic elegy.</p><p>Born in 1926, Jan Morris is the author of such classics as the Pax Britannica trilogy and The World, among many others. She lives in Wales.&#x201c;The short, illustrated book Morris has written about the Yamato is what she calls 'a reverie' on the varied emotions that war summons up...I think it's safe to say that Morris has also written a reverie on accepting the inevitability of death....This book itself signals yet another end: Certainly, it will be one of the very last books written about World War II by an author who saw active service in that war. That sobering fact only adds to the elegiac resonance of this magnificent little book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Maureen Corrigan, NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i></strong></p><h2>Spanish the Easy Way (Easy Way Series)</h2><p>Here is a fundamental introduction to speaking, understanding, and writing in Spanish, with emphasis on oral proficiency.

In contrast to a materials science approach, Hyer emphasizes the micromechanics of stress and deformation for composite material analysis. The book provides invaluable analytic tools for students and engineers seeking to understand composite properties and failure limits. A key feature is a series of analytic problems continuing throughout the text, starting from relatively simple problems, which are built up step-by-step with accompanying calculations. The problem series uses the same material properties, so the impact of the elastic and thermal expansion properties for a single-layer of FR material on the stress, strains, elastic properties, thermal expansion and failure stress of cross-ply and angle-ply symmetric and unsymmetric laminates can be evaluated. The book shows how thermally induced stresses and strains due to curing, add to or subtract from those due to applied loads. Another important element, and one unique to this book, is an emphasis on the difference between specifying the applied loads, i.e., force and moment results, often the case in practice, versus specifying strains and curvatures and determining the subsequent stresses and force and moment results. This represents a fundamental distinction in solid mechanics.<p>Table of Contents follows: 1. Fiber-Reinforced Composite Materials 2.

Her worldwide popularity is phenomenal, her characters engaging, her plots spellbinding. No one knows the human heart--or the dark passions that can stop it--better than Agatha Christie. She is truly the one and only Queen of Crime.</p><p>The Body in the Library</p><p>The body of a beautiful blonde is found in the library of Gossington Hall. What the young woman was doing in the quiet village of St. Mary Mead is precisely what Jane Marple means to find out. Amid rumors of scandal, Miss Marple baits a clever trap to catch a ruthless killer.</p></p><p><p>It&#x2019;s seven in the morning. The Bantrys wake to find the body of a young woman in their library. She is wearing an evening dress and heavy makeup, which is now smeared across her cheeks. But who is she? How did she get there? And what is the connection with another dead girl, whose charred remains are later discovered in an abandoned quarry? The respectable Bantrys invite Miss Marple to solve the mystery . . . before tongues start to wag.</p>Agatha Christie is the world's best known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.<p>Her writing career spanned more than half a century, during which she wrote 79 novels and short story collections, as well as 14 plays, one of which, <i>The Mousetrap,</i> is the longest-running play in history. Two of the characters she created, the brilliant little Belgian Hercule Poirot and the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple, went on to become world-famous detectives. Both have been widely dramatized in feature films and made-for-TV movies. </p><p>Agatha Christie also wrote six romantic novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. As well, she wrote four nonfiction books including an autobiography and an entertaining account of the many expeditions she shared with her archaeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan. </p><p>Agatha Christie died in 1976.</p></p><h2>The Distinction of Fiction</h2><p><p>Winner of the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies from the Modern Language Association </p><p><i>Winner of the Modern Language Association's Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies</i></p><p>The border between fact and fiction has been trespassed so often it seems to be a highway. Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused.</p><p>In <i>The Distinction of Fiction</i>, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust's <i>A la Recherche du temps perdu</i>, Mann's <i>Death in Venice</i>, Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>, and Freud's case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that <i>all</i> narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn's Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, <i>The Distinction of Fiction</i> builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.</p></p><p><p><b>Dorrit Cohn </b> is a professor emerita of the Departments of German and Comparative Literature at Harvard University. Her previous books include <i>The Sleepwalkers: Elucidations of Herman Broch's Trilogy</i> and <i>Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction</i>.</p><p>"Offers some very fine analysis of a range of narratives from Freud's case histories to Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>... An important contribution to narrative theory and a salutary intervention in the debate about the relation between fiction and nonfiction... Cohn argues with clarity, learning, and patient logic."</p> (James Phelan <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"The first chapter, which anatomizes the various meanings of the term 'fiction' in critical discourse, shows Cohn at her best, scrupulously and methodically distinguishing between shifting and rival senses of the term 'fiction.'."</p> (Brian Richardson <i>Novel</i>)<br><br><p>"[T]his collection offers a convenient way of sampling the ideas of a well respected critic who has had substantial and lasting impact on narratological studies."</p> (Hollie Markland Harder <i>French Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Dorrit Cohn demolishes, with remorseless and elegant clarity, the view, fashionable among some literary theorists, that there is ultimately no distinction between historical and fictional narrative."</p> (Michael Bell <i>Yearbook of English Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"Elegantly written and demonstrates an impressive knowledge of scholarship in the theoretical field of narratology."</p> (Amy J. Elias <i>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Distinction of Fiction</i> will [become] required reading for all those interested in the formal workings of narrative... Readers willing to trace and retrace the rigorous intricacies of Cohn's presentation will find that the effort leads to ample and even exhilarating rewards."</p> (Patrick O'Neill <i>Seminar</i>)<br><br><p>"Careful and lucid theoretical work in narratology."</p> (Ursula Mahlendorf <i>Colloquia Germanica</i>)<br><br><p>"Dorrit Cohn provides us with a comprehensive survey of the controversy about the relation between factual and fictional narration, and shows how it might be resolved.

And the surprise ending changes Daredevil&#39;s place in the Marvel Universe forever.</p><p>The seventh volume of Bendis's Daredevil series brings his central story to a close, while opening up new possibilities for the future. Daredevil is dealing with the public revelation of his identity as blind attorney Matt Murdock when his greatest enemy, the Kingpin, returns from the grave to rule over New York City again. With him, he brings two of the hero's greatest enemies, the unstable Typhoid Mary and the crazed Bullseye. But this time, Daredevil decides to end these conflicts once and for all. Bendis writes this series as though it is a film; the Kingpin's return and rise to power are straight out of a movie like Scarface: bloody, glib and dramatic all at once. His pacing is superb, as the Kingpin and Daredevil run parallel courses, building tension until they finally collide and battle through an entire issue at the book's conclusion. If Bendis is writing a film, then artist Maleev is drawing one - each panel is like a still from a movie on paper. When this works, as in the kinetic fight scenes, it's thrilling and grandiose, but it's less effective for tender moments, such as the romantic subplot involving Matt Murdock and a new girlfriend who's also blind. Hardcore is engrossing and broad enough in theme and character to absorb fans of Daredevil's adventures from both the silver screen and the comic books.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His characterizations... are comparable to those in Norman Mailer's journalism." <br>&#x2014;<em>The Boston Globe</em> </p><p>A groundbreaking work&#x2014;named one of the five most influential sports books of the decade by <em>Sports Illustrated&#x2014;How Soccer Explains the World</em> is a unique and brilliantly illuminating look at soccer, the world&#x2019;s most popular sport, as a lens through which to view the pressing issues of our age, from the clash of civilizations to the global economy.</p></p><p>The global power of soccer might be a little hard for Americans, living in a country that views the game with the same skepticism used for the metric system and the threat of killer bees, to grasp fully. But in Europe, South America, and elsewhere, soccer is not merely a pastime but often an expression of the social, economic, political, and racial composition of the communities that host both the teams and their throngs of enthusiastic fans. New Republic editor Franklin Foer, a lifelong devotee of soccer dating from his own inept youth playing days to an adulthood of obsessive fandom, examines soccer's role in various cultures as a means of examining the reach of globalization. Foer's approach is long on soccer reportage, providing extensive history and fascinating interviews on the Rangers-Celtic rivalry and the inner workings of AC Milan, and light on direct discussion of issues like world trade and the exportation of Western culture. But by creating such a compelling narrative of soccer around the planet, Foer draws the reader into these sport-mad societies, and subtly provides the explanations he promises in chapters with titles like "How Soccer Explains the New Oligarchs", "How Soccer Explains Islam's Hope", and "How Soccer Explains the Sentimental Hooligan." Foer's own passion for the game gives his book an infectious energy but still pales in comparison to the religious fervor of his subjects. His portraits of legendary hooligans in Serbia and Britain, in particular, make the most die-hard roughneck New York Yankees fan look like a choirboy in comparison. Beyond the thugs, Foer also profiles Nigerian players living in the Ukraine, Iranian women struggling against strict edicts to attend matches, and the parallel worlds of Brazilian soccer and politics from which Pele emerged and returned. Foer posits that globalization has eliminated neither local cultural identities nor violent hatred among fans of rival teams, and it has not washed out local businesses in a sea of corporate wealth nor has it quelled rampant local corruption. Readers with an interest in international economics are sure to like <i>How Soccer Explains the World</i>, but soccer fans will love it. <i>--John Moe</i><p><strong>Religious, economic, political and ethnic divisions around the world are dramatically illuminated using the world's most popular sport as a lens and metaphor. A groundbreaking work. </strong> </p><p> Soccer is much more than a game, or even a way of life. In fact, it's a perfect window into the cross&#x2013;currents of today's world, with all of its joys and sorrows. Soccer clubs don't represent geographic areas; they stand for social classes and political ideologies. And unlike baseball or tennis, soccer is freighted with the weight of ancient hatreds and history. It's a sport with real stakes &#x2013;&#x2013; one that is capable of ruining regimes and launching liberation movements.In this remarkably insightful, wide&#x2013;ranging work of reportage, Franklin Foer takes us on a surprising tour through the world of soccer, shattering the myths of our new global age. Instead of destroying local cultures, as the left predicted, globalization has revived tribalism. Far from the triumph of capitalism that the right predicted, it has entrenched corruption. From Brazil to Bosnia, and Italy to Iran, this is an eye&#x2013;opening chronicle of how a beautiful sport and its fanatical followers can highlight the fault lines of a society, whether it's terrorism, poverty, anti&#x2013;Semitism, or radical Islam &#x2013;&#x2013; issues that now have an impact on all of us. Filled with blazing intelligence, colourful characters, wry humour, and an equal passion for soccer and humanity, <em>How Soccer Explains the World</em> is an utterly original book that makes sense of our troubled times. </p><p> </p></p><h2>Tangled</h2><p>Mourning the loss of her husband, who died in the Crimean War, beautiful Rebecca Cardwell enters into a marriage of convenience with her husband&#39;s best friend, only to discover that he has awakened her deepest passions.

Born Janet Miriam Holland Taylor Caldwell in Manchester, England, she moved with her family to Buffalo, New York, in 1907. She started writing stories when she was eight years old and completed her first novel when she was twelve. Married at age eighteen, Caldwell worked as a stenographer and court reporter to help support her family and took college courses at night, earning a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Buffalo in 1931. She adopted the pen name Taylor Caldwell because legendary editor Maxwell Perkins thought her debut novel, <i>Dynasty of Death </i>(1938), would be better received if readers assumed it were written by a man. In a career that spanned five decades, Caldwell published forty novels, many of which were <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. Her best-known works include the historical sagas <i>The Sound of Thunder </i>(1957), <i>Testimony of Two Men </i>(1968), <i>Captains and the Kings </i>(1972), and <i>Ceremony of the Innocent </i>(1976), and the spiritually themed novels <i>The Listener </i>(1960) and <i>No One Hears But Him </i>(1966). <i>Dear and Glorious Physician </i>(1958), a portrayal of the life of St. Luke, and <i>Great Lion of God</i> (1970), about the life of St. Paul, are among the bestselling religious novels of all time. Caldwell&#x2019;s last novel, <i>Answer as a Man</i> (1981), hit the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list before its official publication date.

We were listlessly toying with whatever we could find to keep our minds occupied. All our phones were on the table, waiting. The minute one of them rang, we&#x2019;d spring into action&#x2014;and we knew there would be a call. Until then, Camille was reading, Delilah was working a crossword puzzle, and I was trying to unknot a jumble of thin gold chains that had gotten tangled up when I tossed them in the jewelry box without thinking.</p><p>Dropping into the chair next to me, Nerissa used the towel hanging around her neck to wipe the sweat off her brow. She had just returned from her workout with Jason Binds, a mechanic-cum-martial-arts-instructor. He was attempting to turn her into a lean, mean shredding machine. Her face was clear of makeup, her workout top was soaked through with perspiration, and her tawny mane of hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, although a few wisps had escaped to straggle out. But to me, my wife was the most beautiful sight in the world.</p><p>&#x201c;No, but it&#x2019;s only a matter of time. We haven&#x2019;t had a quiet night in several weeks.&#x201d; I pushed the chains aside. I had doused them in oil and was trying to use a straight pin to separate the tangle. I wiped my oily fingers on a napkin and reached for her hand.</p><p>Camille and Delilah had been awake since around five p.m. I, of course, rose at sunset, which was&#x2014;in early May&#x2014;running closer to eight thirty. I longed for autumn and winter, when the nights were longer and I could rise earlier and stay up longer. Sometimes I thought I should move to Alaska for half the year, when the darkness held sway over the land. My sisters had switched over to a nocturnal schedule because, so far, all of the attacks had come during the night&#x2014;usually around two or three a.m.</p><p>Everything had snowballed so quickly that we gave up waiting around, and now&#x2014;instead of simply responding to the danger, we had gone on the offensive. At the first sign of dusk, the guys headed out, hunting for any signs of trouble as they scoured the city. My sisters and I waited at home for their call.</p><p>If they found a problem before someone reported a skirmish to the Faerie-Human Crime Scene Investigation Unit, the men called us and we headed out to put out the fire. If the FH-CSI got the call first, they transferred it over to us. Either way, we were front on the line. So far, we had managed to keep this nightmare under wraps, but we were barely holding on. All it would take would be one misstep or overlooked incursion and everything would blow sky high. Once news of what had been going on hit the papers, the ensuing panic would take over from there. We were trying to prevent that panic from happening in the first place.</p><p>Earlier, the three of us had pored over a map of the city, trying to figure out if there was some pattern to the attacks. Never mind that we&#x2019;d already gone over it a dozen times&#x2014;the activity kept us busy, and right now, busy was good because waiting around like this was getting on all of our nerves.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to shower and change.&#x201d; Nerissa pushed back her chair and stood.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry up and I&#x2019;ll have your dinner waiting.&#x201d; Iris set a plate of grilled cheese sandwiches on the table in front of Camille and Delilah. She handed them mugs of hot tomato soup. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not cooking anything extravagant because right now, fancy takes too much time. I want to make certain you all get good, solid food into you.&#x201d;</p><p>Nerissa nodded. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be long. I&#x2019;m so sweaty from working out, and I need to rinse off, but I&#x2019;ll be quick. Thank gods there&#x2019;s been a lull tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced over up at her. &#x201c;So, how did it go at Jason&#x2019;s?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. He says that I&#x2019;m learning extremely fast.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;I wish I could make more progress, but he seems satisfied so I guess I should take what I can get.&#x201d; With a glance at the clock, she added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get moving. We really don&#x2019;t have the luxury of just hanging out anymore, I guess.&#x201d; Sounding sad, she leaned down to meet my lips.</p><p>The proximity to her body and her hot breath on my cheek made me ache. I wanted nothing more than to curl up with her in the living room. I wanted to cuddle with her and Maggie while we watched the Demon Twins play video games and listened to Iris and Hanna argue over who made the best pie. Basically, I wanted to just go about my daily routine and forget that all of this was happening. But reality was biting us on the ass, hard and fast and with sharp teeth. As Chase was fond of saying, If wishes were pennies, we&#x2019;d all be rich.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be too long. We haven&#x2019;t had a call yet tonight and you know it&#x2019;s going to come.&#x201d;</p><p>As she headed toward the bath near the laundry room, a high-pitched note sounded from a ring of crystals sitting on an end table in the kitchen. Nerissa froze as Camille ran over to the wards. Delilah and I immediately shifted into prep-for-battle mode. Nobody had broken through to our land lately, but with everything going on, we didn&#x2019;t dare ignore the rogue portal out in the backyard. Even though it had been tuned to the realm of the Elder Fae, the very fact that it was a portal still made our home a dangerous target. And not five miles away was Grandmother Coyote&#x2019;s portal to Otherworld. Though, I thought with a silent grin, I would hate to see what she would do to anybody who tried to mess with her.</p><p>Camille ran her hands over the crystals, which had calmed down. &#x201c;Nothing to worry about. I think it&#x2019;s just some ghost or something passing through. But, Delilah, can you run and ask the guards to make a sweep around the land? Just to be on the safe side.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On it.&#x201d; Kitten was up and out the door before Camille could say another word.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m getting my shower in.&#x201d; Nerissa planted another kiss on my lips. I lingered in her embrace, wanting to stay there forever. I loved her more than I thought I ever could love anybody.</p><p>I slapped her on the ass. &#x201c;Get moving, wife.&#x201d;</p><p>As she darted into the bathroom, I thought about how close I had come to losing her. Only a few months back, we were having serious problems. But I had finally listened to my sisters, and I had quit being so pigheaded. Especially after Vanzir dragged me off to one side to inform me of what an ass I had become. When he wanted to be, he could be extremely blunt and unflattering. But I appreciated his warning because he was right.</p><p>I finally I started talking to Nerissa instead of talking over her. But mostly, I started listening to her worries and complaints, and taking them seriously. Turns out, shutting up and paying attention? Actually works. Now, though we weren&#x2019;t perfect and never would be, it felt like we were finally on the same page. And honesty and clarity were a whole lot better than the illusion of perfection.</p><p>As the sound of the shower started up, I went back to the chains, my thoughts still lingering over the dangers. We&#x2019;d done our best to mitigate the hazards. Hanna and Maggie were sleeping in my lair during the night because we never knew when we&#x2019;d be called out, and we didn&#x2019;t want them in any sort of danger.</p><p>Because of their proximity to the rogue portal out back, Iris&#x2019;s husband Bruce had taken the babies&#x2014;including Chase&#x2019;s daughter, Astrid&#x2014;and moved into Nerissa&#x2019;s old condo. His mother had come to help out, along with a nanny and a guard. We needed Iris here with us, so she spent her days with her family and her nights with us. And Tanne Baum, the Woodland Fae from the Black Forest, was on twenty-four-hour call, only a speed dial away.</p><p>The doorbell rang. I answered it, surprised to see Chase there, a tray of drinks in his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I stopped at Starbucks before I came over. I thought it might make a buffer for what I have to say.&#x201d; He forced a pale smile, looking as stretched thin as we all felt.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-oh, that sounds bad.&#x201d; I took the tray from him and led him into the kitchen.</p><p>Camille put her marker in her book. Chase had brought a grande chai latte for Delilah. Camille got the iced venti quad shot mocha. And Chase, the venti black coffee with cream. I foraged in the refrigerator for a bottle of blood, enchanted to a chocolate flavor. Thanks to Morio, I had a wide variety of choices.</p><p>Chase settled down at the table beside me, but before the detective could say a word, Camille&#x2019;s phone rang. She stared at it, a dark wave steeling her gaze, then answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes? How many? Okay, we&#x2019;re on the way. Text us the directions.&#x201d; She punched the Off button and texted Delilah to get her ass around front ASAP, then yanked the top off her iced mocha to gulp down as much as she could. &#x201c;We have to book. That was Morio. A raiding party&#x2019;s breaking through a rogue portal in Vanderson Park. At least a dozen goblins and twice that many bone-walkers. There may be more&#x2014;they just started coming through the portal when Morio called me. He and Vanzir will hold them off as best as they can until everybody gets there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to talk later, Chase. Wait here for us? When Nerissa gets out of the shower, tell her where we went, if you would.&#x201d; I grabbed my keys, then jammed my wallet in the pocket of my jeans.</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the Supe militia and put them on standby. One word from you and they&#x2019;ll be on the way.&#x201d; He pulled out his phone. &#x201c;Text me directions the minute you get them. I&#x2019;ll have Frank and the boys ready to roll if need be.&#x201d;</p><p>Without another word, we grabbed our jackets and headed into the cool, clear evening. I glanced up at the stars that hung over us like an icy canopy, wondering how long we could keep this up. But we couldn&#x2019;t falter. If we did, Telazhar would win, and Earthside would turn into a vast battleground.</p><p>Vanderson Park was about fifteen minutes out from our house in the Belles-Faire district of Seattle. Thank the gods, traffic was scarce, so we made good time. I reached the parking lot first, but Camille and Delilah were close on my heels, and they swerved into the parking lot behind me. As we slipped out of our cars, we could hear shouts coming from beyond a nearby copse of trees.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck, let&#x2019;s hope that there aren&#x2019;t any joggers out here braving the chill for a late-night run. And speaking of weather, the calendar says it&#x2019;s May, but it feels like March tonight. Where are the temps in the seventies that the weather guys promised us?&#x201d; Camille neatly slid her dagger into the sheath strapped to her thigh, over the leg of her catsuit. She started jogging toward the shouts.</p><p>&#x201c;News report said the warm front is stalled off the coast but should move in by tomorrow afternoon.&#x201d; Delilah joined her.</p><p>I caught up to them. We followed the curve of the sidewalk, twisting around the bend to see Morio and Vanzir in the middle of a copse of maple trees, caught in midbattle.</p><p>A host of bone-walkers swarmed around them, magically animated skeletons that were dangerous and hard to kill. Hack them to pieces and the bones would still skitter until the spell wore itself out. The goblins hung back, shouting encouragement to the bone-walkers. They were using the skeletons as cannon fodder to take the brunt of the damage, which made total sense. Wearing out the enemy before you have to face them was never a losing proposition. Just then, a shout from the other direction told us Shade and Trillian had arrived. Smoky and Rozurial would be on the way.</p><p>&#x201c;We have to prevent the goblins from getting out of the park.&#x201d; I moved toward a pair of the ugly brutes, but they dodged behind a big boulder.</p><p>Camille headed toward Morio. The two of them could do far more damage working together than separately&#x2014;their death magic was growing stronger every day, it seemed. Delilah unsheathed Lysanthra&#x2014;her sentient dagger. The blade hummed with a shrill growl of hunger as it smelled goblin blood. As she jockeyed into position with a bone-walker, I sped into a run, then, using the boulder that was standing between us as a springboard, launched myself into the fight, landing square in front of two of the goblins. Their eyes lit up until I smiled, my fangs descending. A sudden lack of enthusiasm flashed across their faces and I smiled, satisfied.</p><p>&#x201c;The oh-shit-it&#x2019;s-a-vampire look works for you, boys.&#x201d; I darted in, ignoring their blades. Unless they clipped me in the heart or cut off my head, they couldn&#x2019;t do anything to me that couldn&#x2019;t be repaired.</p><p>One of them managed to dance out of my way, but the other was within easy reach. I barreled into him, knocking him down and landing on his chest. Throwing my head back, I bared my fangs and lunged at his throat, savagely tearing into the flesh. As muscle was severed from muscle, veins ripping, the blood stained my lips, sending me into a frenzy. I&#x2019;d been doing a lot of this lately, and each time, it seemed to get easier. I caught a mouthful of the fountaining liquid, hot and coppery and fresh on my tongue and gulped it down. Ignoring the aftertaste&#x2014;goblin blood was nasty at best&#x2014;I staved off the desire to stay and drink deep. I rolled to the side and came to my feet. The goblin gurgled with one last burbling noise and collapsed.</p><p>His buddy took one look at his dead comrade and raised his sword. I recognized the look in his eye. Vengeance mixed with stupidity did not for sanity or safety make. He tossed the sword from hand to hand, showing off, a shit-eating grin on his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sugar, you really don&#x2019;t want to waste your last minutes trying to impress me.&#x201d; I sauntered toward him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken down creatures far bigger and badder than you. And maybe you should remember what just happened to your buddy. After all, a vampire&#x2019;s gotta do what a vampire&#x2019;s gotta do.&#x201d;</p><p>I bent my knees slightly and launched myself into the air, flipping over his head to land in back of him, very Bruce Lee. As the goblin let out a surprised grunt and struggled to turn around, I slammed against his back, knocking him forward onto his own sword. He shouted &#x201c;Oh crap!&#x201d; in Calouk&#x2014;the common tongue of Otherworld&#x2014;but I cut him off. I grabbed his head and wrenched his neck to the side, the resounding crack putting a stop to anything else he might have to say.</p><p>On my feet again, I turned, staring at the host of creatures surrounding us.</p><p>Camille and Morio had joined hands and were taking down a circle of bone-walkers with their death magic. The purple lightning from the circle of power surrounding them crackled, destroying every skeleton it touched as they walked forward, driving the magic in front of them. Delilah was slashing her way through the goblins, her blade singing every time it bit deep into the flesh of one of the creatures.</p><p>A glance toward the parking lot announced the arrival of Smoky and Roz. They asked no questions, merely joined Shade and Trillian, who were knee deep in battle, driving their swords through the chaos that spilled out from the portal.</p><p>Vanzir was guarding the vortex, attacking as more goblins poured through the opening. He couldn&#x2019;t prevent them from coming through, but he was making a dent in the incoming tide. And, thank the gods, only a handful of goblins could come through at a time. We were lucky in that regard.</p><p>The energy vortex spread between two of the tallest trees like a spider&#x2019;s web, overshadowing the brilliant green of early-summer leaves.

His main themes are mutational errors in the copying of DNA and how Mendelian inheritance is designed to prevent selfish genes from taking over. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><i>The Cooperative Gene</i> is about sex and how sex enabled complex life to arise. Mark Ridley, a researcher and author of many works including the textbook <i>Evolution</i>, contends that simple life is "easy." Simple life like bacteria evolved as soon as conditions on Earth permitted. But complex life--walking, flying, swimming, squawking organisms with differentiated tissues--was a huge step forward. It took billions of years for complex life (and sex) to appear.<p> More than anything, organisms want to pass on their genes. Sex seems to defy natural selection in its ability to convince organisms to pass on only half their genes. Natural selection will favor "selfish" genes, ones that can beat the odds and get passed on. But if this happened all the time, complex life could not exist. So how does it? Enter what Ridley describes as "Mendel's demon," a system in which genes are passed on in a random fashion. Most important, the demon prevents selfish genes from sabotaging that randomness.</p><p> Although <i>Gene</i> isn't a technical book, its ideas are complicated. Ridley's style is methodical, broken by the occasional dryly humorous aside. Evolutionary biologists and other assorted PhDs will no doubt be entertained. Popular-science buffs may find it slow going, but they will be rewarded by a thorough understanding of the topic.</p><p> In his last two chapters, Ridley leaps further afield, exploring the influence of technology on human evolution and speculating how future science could change us. He also examines the idea of supercomplex organisms, beings that would tower over humans in complexity to the same degree that humans tower over bacteria. It's pure speculation but compelling nonetheless, worthy of its own book. <i>--J. B. Peck</i></p><b>Mark Ridley</b> pursues his research in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford.

Murrow, Elie de Rothschild, Averell Harriman ... What&#39;s more astonishing is that along the way Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman managed to find time to become an accomplished globe-trotting socialite, a mother, a leading fundraiser and den mother for the Democratic Party, and, today, the American Ambassador to France. Sally Bedell Smith sought out Pamela Harriman&#39;s most far-flung associates and detailed everything from her subject&#39;s cosmetic surgeries to her fudged studies at the Sorbonne to produce this exhaustive work, and though the subject comes across as cold, calculating, and duplicitous, there is a grudging admiration for the century&#39;s ultimate courtesan.In 1994, Christopher Ogden, employed by Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman to ghost her autobiography, published Life of the Party. When she balked at exposing the spicier side of her career, he went ahead on his own, using her taped interviews, but legally he could quote nothing. Smith, another unauthorized biographer, quotes little from Harriman, written or vocal, for similar reasons, but 400 of her acquaintances cooperated, resulting in a deeply informed and revelatory study. Smith (All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley) has done further homework in financial and court papers and in the diaries, letters and memoirs of contemporaries. Had it not been for Ogden's preemptive strike, Smith's intensely detailed biography of the least sedate of American ambassadors?British-born Pamela Harriman, now 76, represents the U.S. in Paris?would be even more explosive. Perhaps only in France, where premiers and presidents often have publicly acknowledged mistresses, would she be acceptable, even admired, as an envoy. Bedding her way to wealth and power, the resourceful red-haired beauty wed Randolph Churchill, Leland Hayward and Averell Harriman, filling in the interstices between marriages with Edward R. Murrow (her only unmoneyed lover), Gianni Agnelli, Aly Khan, Elie de Rothschild and other deep-pocketed admirers. Said one observer: "She could make a man, not just in bed. She stretched a man's horizons." Austerity was never her cup of tea, nor was familial loyalty to the children and grandchildren inherited from two American husbands. Her lifestyle, Smith contends, was always based on self-aggrandizement. As a former Hayward wife remarked, "Pam Churchill thought she would marry [Fiat heir] Agnelli, so she became a Catholic on spec." Brushing aside her reputation as grande cocotte, a French friend scoffed, "Everyone has a past. It is who she is today that counts." Photos not seen by PW.

Here are Pythagoras, intoxicated by the mystical significance of numbers; Euclid, who gave the world the very idea of a proof; Leibniz and Newton, co-discoverers of the calculus; Cantor, master of the infinite; and G�del, who in one magnificent proof placed everything in doubt.<br> <br>The elaboration of mathematical knowledge has meant nothing less than the unfolding of human consciousness itself. With his unmatched ability to make abstract ideas concrete and approachable, Berlinski both tells an engrossing tale and introduces us to the full power of what surely ranks as one of the greatest of all human endeavors.</p><p>David Berlinski received his Ph.D. from Princeton University and has taught mathematics, philosophy, and English at Stanford, Rutgers, the University of Puget Sound, and the Universit� de Paris at Jussieu. He has been a research fellow at both the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and the Institut des Hautes �tudes Scientifiques in France. His many books have been translated into more than a dozen European and Asian languages. His essays in Commentary have become famous. A senior fellow at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, he lives and works in Paris.Chapter 1<br><br> Number<br><br> The history of mathematics begins in 532 BC, the date marking the birth of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Having fled the island of Samos in order to escape the tyranny of Polycrates, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt, where, like so many impressionable young Greek men, he &#x201c;learned number and measure from Egyptians [and] was astonished at the wisdom of the priests.&#x201d; Thereafter, he settled in southern Italy; he began teaching and quickly attracted disciples. Very little is known directly of his life, except that his contemporaries considered him admirable. Nothing from his own hand remains: He has been preserved against the worm of time by the amber of various literary artifacts. Admission to the Pythagorean sect was evidently based on mathematical ability. Secrecy was enforced and dietary restrictions against beans maintained. New members were required to keep silent for a number of years, a policy that even today many teachers will find admirable, and they were expected during this time to meditate and reflect. Some members of the Pythagorean sect regarded the external world as a prison, a cave filled with flickering shadows and dull brutish shapes. Let me add to this confused but static scene the heat lightning of superb mathematical intuition.<br><br> Until the mid-twentieth century, the thesis that in mathematics as in almost everything else, the Greeks were there at first light, did not require an elaborate defense. With their forearms draped in friendship over any number of toga-clad shoulders, classicists who had spent years mastering infernal Greek declensions naturally assumed that the &#x201c;Greeks were fellows of another college.&#x201d; The history of the Ancient Near East has come into sharper focus over the past century, great scholars poring over cuneiform tablets and re-creating the life of ancient empires that had until their work been swallowed up as the impenetrable before. They have found remarkable things, a history before classical history, evidence that men and women have used and loved mathematics in the time before time began. Neolithic ax-marks have even suggested that the origins of mathematics lie impossibly far in the past, and that men living in caves, their hairy torsos covered by vile-smelling furs, chipped the names of the numbers onto their ax handles as bison grease spattered over an open fire. And why not? Like language itself, mathematics is an inheritance of the race.<br><br> The burden of those impossibly distant centuries now disappears. It is roughly six centuries before the birth of Christ. The Greeks are just about to elbow their way into all the corridors of culture. They give every indication of knowing everything and having known it all along. Yet the Babylonians already possessed a remarkably sophisticated body of mathematical knowledge. They were matchless observational astronomers, and they had brought a number of celestial phenomena under the control of precise mathematical techniques. They were immensely clever. &#x201c;I found a stone, but did not weigh it,&#x201d; one scribe wrote. &#x201c;I then weighed out six times its weight, added two gin, and then added one third of one seventh, multiplied by twenty-four. I weighed it. [The result came to] one ma-na.&#x201d; &#x201c;What,&#x201d; the scribe now asks his oil-haired students, &#x201c;was the original weight of the stone?&#x201d; Mathematicians are apt to see an all-too-familiar face peeping through the problems of a Babylonian scribe&#x2014;their face, of course, ubiquitous and always the same.<br><br> But those classicists sipping sherry in the common room of time had been right all along. The Greeks were there at first light.<br><br> The natural numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . begin at one and they go on forever, the mathematician&#x2019;s dainty dots signifying an endless progression. As soon as anyone attempts to cap the natural numbers, anyone can find a way to cap the cap, say by adding one to the last natural number capped. If the numbers are infinite, they are also wonderfully various. When the great Indian prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan lay dying in a London hospital, the cold English winters eating his lungs away now ending his life, his friend, the mathematician G. H. Hardy, paid him a visit. Paralyzed by his own reticence, Hardy could think only to blurt out the number of the taxi that had brought him to the hospital&#x2014;1729, as it happens.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose it is a very interesting number,&#x201d; he added.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, no, Hardy,&#x201d; Ramanujan replied at once, &#x201c;it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.&#x201d;<br><br> And so it is: 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. No smaller number has this property. The story has become famous. No one quite knows what it means, but every mathematician understands why it is told.<br><br> Like Ramanujan, the Pythagoreans were taken with the inexhaustible variety of the natural numbers, their personalities. They were fascinated by 1, 3, 6, and 10, because these numbers could be expressed geometrically as triangles composed of dots. They quite understood the importance of numbers that are divisible only by themselves and 1&#x2014;the prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11; and they may well have understood that the prime numbers are fundamental, lying like dark rubies amid the pale panoply of the ordinary numbers. They discovered that certain numbers such as 6, 28, and 496 could be expressed as the sum of their divisors. They lived in caves&#x2014;I mean such is the legend&#x2014;and squatting there, a pile of smooth pebbles in their laps, they saw that there are square numbers as well as triangular numbers, and amicable relationships between numbers, as when each of two numbers is the sum of the other&#x2019;s divisors, or when the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers such as 3 and 6 is a square number, and progressions from one series of numbers to another; and in all this, as the tallow dripped from their candles, they treated the natural numbers as if they were themselves men at play, serious but never solemn, their endless curiosity amounting at times to a form of intellectual rapture and so entirely alien to the beetle-browed scribes and accountants of the Ancient Near East, men forever plodding along the severe utilitarian axis of a commercial culture.<br><br> What did the Pythagoreans care for some pharaoh&#x2019;s monstrous pyramid or staring one-eyed sphinx? They were mathematicians.<br><br> Superstitious? Of course they were, but Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans were devoted to a higher spookiness. It is their distinction. With his vein-ruined hands describing circles in the smoky air, Pythagoras has come to believe in numbers, their unearthly harmonies and strange symmetries. &#x201c;Number is the first principle,&#x201d; he affirmed, &#x201c;a thing which is undefined, incomprehensible, [and] having in itself all numbers.&#x201d; The number one, the Pythagoreans termed the monad, and at times they seemed to suggest that the natural numbers might be subordinated to a dull grunting process by which all of the numbers could be generated from the monad, number creation monstrous and pullulating. &#x201c;And the first principle of numbers is in substance the first monad, which is a male monad, begetting as a father all other numbers.&#x201d; The numbers two, three, and four enter into Pythagorean thought scent-marked from the first, the number two, because it is squat and feminine, and three, because it marks a return to the masculine, its three-tipped triangle when inverted (base up, apex down) looking very much as if a pair of wide-spread shoulders were descending toward a manly groin. The number four merits celebration&#x2014;but I really have no idea why it does, except for the fact that one, two, three, and four sum to ten, at which point the number series topples back to one, with eleven expressed as the sum of one and ten. It is the number ten that served the Pythagoreans as the object of a sacred oath, one offered at night in the owl-hooted landscape and dedicated to &#x201c;him that transmitted to our soul the tetraktys, which has the spring and root of ever-flowing nature.&#x201d;<br><br> Half-mad, I suppose, and ecstatic, Pythagorean thought offers us the chance to peer downward into the deep unconscious place where mathematics has its origins, the natural numbers seen as they must have been seen for the very first time, and that is as some powerful erotic aspect of creation itself. &#x201c;Number,&#x201d; the Pythagoreans wrote, &#x201c;is the essence of all things.&#x201d; Time has long scattered the Pythagoreans and canceled their sense of play, and yet the declaration that number is the essence of all things has lost none of its thrilling intellectual power. Number? And the essence of all things? Of all things? The Greeks heard those unearthly and mysterious words and tried to give them sense, but sand needed to sift over the monuments of antiquity before they would again enter into the mathematician&#x2019;s self-confident self-consciousness. When Galileo initiated the great scientific revolution of the West, writing that the Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics, he was reconveying that Pythagorean note, those Pythagorean words.<br><br> The Pythagoreans never succeeded in explaining what they meant by claiming that number is the essence of all things. Early in the life of the sect, they conjectured that numbers might be the essence of all things because quite literally &#x201c;the elements of numbers were the elements of all things.&#x201d; In this way, Aristotle remarks, &#x201c;they constructed the whole heaven out of numbers.&#x201d; This view they could not sustain. Aristotle notes dryly that &#x201c;it is impossible that [physical] bodies should consist of numbers,&#x201d; ...</p><h2>Stanley Kubrick and Me: Thirty Years at His Side</h2><p><b>This intimate portrait by his former personal assistant and confidante reveals the man behind the legendary filmmaker&#x2014;for the first time.</b><br><br>Stanley Kubrick, the director of a string of timeless movies from <i>Lolita</i> and <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> to <i>A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket,</i> and others, has always been depicted by the media as the Howard Hughes of filmmakers, a weird artist obsessed with his work and privacy to the point of madness. But who was he really? Emilio D'Alessandro lets us see. A former Formula Ford driver who was a minicab chauffeur in London during the Swinging Sixties, he took a job driving a giant phallus through the city that became his introduction to the director. Honest, reliable, and ready to take on any task, Emilio found his way into Kubrick's neurotic, obsessive heart. He became his personal assistant, his right-hand man and confidant, working for him from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> until Kubrick's death in 1999.<br><br>Emilio was the silent guy in the room when the script for <i>The Shining</i> was discussed. He still has the coat Jack Nicholson used in the movie. He was an extra on the set of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, Kubrick's last movie. He knew all the actors and producers Kubrick worked with; he observed firsthand Kubrick's working methods down to the smallest detail. Making no claim of expertise in cinematography but with plenty of anecdotes, he offers a completely fresh perspective on the artist and a warm, affecting portrait of a generous, kind, caring man who was a perfectionist in work and life.</p><p><b>Emilio D'Alessandro</b> left Italy at eighteen to become a racecar driver but turned to driving a minicab after the economic crisis in the late sixties ended his career. He worked closely with Stanley Kubrick for thirty years while raising a family with his wife, Janette. After Kubrick's death, he returned to his native land. He lives in Cassino, Italy.<br><br><b>Filippo Ulivieri</b> was born in 1977. He is a writer and teacher of film theory. The leading expert on Stanley Kubrick in Italy, he has published articles on the director's life and films in several newspapers and magazines, and created the site ArchivioKubrick. He lives in Tuscany and Plymouth, UK."A weird, revealing delight . . . The accretion of details about this seemingly salt of-the-earth working stiff and the eccentric artistic genius who paid him creates an irresistible picture of friendship, loyalty, and artistic temperament. . . . I enjoyed every word." <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"As good an insider's view of middle- to late-period Kubrick as there is. . . . The book is funny and casual throughout. Of special interest are D'Alessandro's set notes, revealing, for example, that the cat lady room in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> figured two decades later in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>." <i>Kirkus</i><br><br> Utterly charming . . . [A] sweet and sentimental record of service to a creative genius . . . the book's invitingly conversational tone and descriptions paint an all-too-human portrait of a cloistered artist and ardent workaholic who expected everything and more from his employees and returned their devotion in kind.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Through detailed anecdotes and tender accounts of life both on location and off, D'Alessandro sheds light behind the scenes of Kubrick's famously controlled sets and offers a unique portrait of the man himself." <i>Vice</i><br><br>"No great man is great for his butler, they say, . . . as if the private life of someone extraordinary should always contradict his public image. That is not the case with the beautiful portrait that Emilio D&#x2019;Alessandro and Filippo Ulivieri paint in <i>Stanley Kubrick and Me</i>. [...] D&#x2019;Alessandro tells about a generous man, caring, perfectionist in his work, demanding in every aspect of the daily life. [...] It is a delightful book, indeed: gentle and delicate as the summer that slowly says goodbye and vanishes." <i>La Stampa</i><br><br>"This memoir is exquisite, not to be missed." <i>Il Sole 24 Ore</i><br><br>"There are so many details about Kubrick&#x2019;s daily life (and I mean 'daily,' not 'private': there is no gossip here) in this outstanding book 352 pages you read in a snap. [...]<i> Stanley Kubrick and Me</i> is perhaps the most important book ever written about Kubrick. It offers a portrait full of warmth, a touching memoir about the filmmaker, and at the same time it clears away all the stupid and crazy stuff about him that has plagued his image for years." <i>L&#x2019;Unit�</i><br><br>"This is a story of genius and sweetness. It is an exciting book because it gives tons of detail about how Kubrick&#x2019;s films were made, but it is also, and surprisingly, a sort of sentimental novel, beautifully written . . . a story of warm feelings an oblique tale of two souls in which genius and humility are knit together and sometimes exchange places."<br> Radio Capital<br><br>"Here is a perfect match, here are two men who greatly admired each other and are happy to show it. [...] Stanley Kubrick and Emilio D&#x2019;Alessandro, the visionary genius and the man who drove him anywhere, the imaginative director and his factotum, the art of thinking and the craft of doing, the mind and the body. They're like two happy kids at a birthday party."<br> <i>Il Venerd� di Repubblica</i><br><br>"His portrayal of Kubrick is heartfelt, yet detached. There is a controlled admiration running through the pages, a need to understand who Kubrick really was beyond the legend, and above all without the usual tales that depict him as someone who was furiously, obsessively, and crazily cut off from the world. [...] Emilio was the ideal character in a unique story, told with devotion, respect, and freedom. Here, there are no unnecessary frills and no implausible details that often damage many accounts of extraordinary encounters."<br> <i>Il Venerd� di Repubblica</i><br><br>"At last, a new book that for the first time seems to succeed in capturing the real Kubrick, the everyday man who is indivisible from the artist, because thanks to the book you see how Kubrick was always on.&#x201d; always working, focused on his job. . . It is a very humorous book, and a touching one, even moving: something that is indeed a paradox for an artist who kept tears constantly away in his films. [...] The book offers relaxing reading for any Kubrick fan who has tried for years to distinguish the truth from the Internet bullshit. After reading the book, I think I love Emilio, and Stanley as well." <i>Globalist</i></p><h2>Harley Brown&#39;s Eternal Truths for Every Artist</h2><p>Harley Brown offers artists his &#34;truths&#34; for painting success-the stuff he hopes they teach in art school.

Who was this young man? A fascist hero whose memory is an embarrassment or a committed idealist who happened to fall on the wrong side of history? Is it possible to be a moral person defending an immoral cause? Through visits back to his parents' village in southern Spain, interviews with survivors, and research into the murkiest corners of the war, the author pieces together the life of this enigmatic figure and of an entire generation. This sui generis work combines intimate family history, investigative scholarship, personal confession, war stories, and road trips, finally becoming a transcendent portrait of a country's indelible scars--a book about heroism, death, the persistence of the past, and the meaning of an individual life against the tapestry of history.</p><p>JAVIER CERCAS was born in 1962. He is a novelist and columnist, and he has received numerous international awards. His books include <i>Soldiers of Salamis </i>(which sold more than a million copies worldwide), <i>The Anatomy of a Moment, The Tenant and The Motive, The Speed of Light,</i> and <i>The Impostor. </i>His books have been translated into more than thirty languages.

Although woodcut novels have their roots spreading back through the history of graphic arts, including block books and playing cards, it was not until the early part of the twentieth century that they were conceived and published. Despite its short-lived popularity, the woodcut novel had an important impact on the development of comic art, particularly contemporary graphic novels with a focus on adult themes. <br><br>Scholar David A.

Neville Lancelot Goddard was born in Barbados in 1905. He came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen and whilst touring with his dance company in England he developed an interest in metaphysics, after striking up a conversation with a Scotsman who lent him a series of books on the powers of the mind. On his return he gave up the entertainment industry to devote his full attention to the study of spiritual and mystical matters. After traveling extensively throughout the United States, Neville eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television and radio, and for many years lectured regularly to capacity audiences. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. In his early lectures and books, Neville dealt solely with what he called The Law, the technique of creating one&#39;s physical reality through imagining. It is this portion of his expression that most closely accords with the teachings of the New Thought movement. In 1959 he began to experience what he called The Promise. In the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s Neville gave more emphasis to The Promise than to The Law. One could use imaginal power to change one&#39;s circumstances, he said, but it would be temporary, &#34;...and will vanish like smoke.&#34; He went on to explain that The Promise superseded The Law, claiming &#34;Oh, you can use it [The Law] to make a fortune, to become known in the world, all these things are done, but, your true purpose here is to fulfill Scripture.&#34; After subordinating The Law to The Promise, he became as eager to hear accounts by those who had experienced The Promise, and sharing such accounts, as he had earlier of those with The Law.The Power of Awareness attempts to demonstrate how to use our mind to realize our wishes. As such, it is an important part of the larger New Though Movement, in which Neville holds a prominent place.</p><p><b>Neville Goddard</b> is well known as one of the most influential teachers and writers of metaphysical work. Nevill was born on 19 February 1905 in Barbados. He was the fourth child in a family of nine boys and one girl. In 1922, Nevill came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen. During his entertaining tour in England as a vaudeville dancer and stage actor, he developed a great interest in metaphysics. Hence, he gave up his entertainment job and became devoted fully to the study of metaphysics and spiritual matters.

In this compelling tale of courage and heroism, glory and tragedy, Ryan painstakingly recreates the fateful hours that preceded and followed the massive invasion of Normandy to retell the story of an epic battle that would turn the tide against world fascism and free Europe from the grip of Nazi Germany.<br> <br>This book, first published in 1959, is a must for anyone who loves history, as well as for anyone who wants to better understand how free nations prevailed at a time when darkness enshrouded the earth.</p><p>A true classic of World War II history, <i>The Longest Day</i> tells the story of the massive Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Journalist Cornelius Ryan began working on the book in the mid-1950s, while the memories of the D-day participants were still fresh, and he spent three years interviewing D-day survivors in the United States and Europe. When his book was first published in 1959, it was tremendously successful, establishing many of the legends of D-day that endure in the public's mind. Ryan was enormously skillful at weaving small personal stories into the overall narrative, and he would later use the same technique to depict the airborne invasion of Holland in <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>. Not only is <i>The Longest Day</i> a pleasure to read, but subsequent historians, dutifully noting its accuracy, have relied heavily on Ryan's research for their own accounts. In short, the book is a "must read" for anyone interested in the D-day invasion. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The World Treasury of Modern Religious Thought</h2><p>Gathers selections from the writings of Camus, Nietzsche, Freud, Einstein, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Solzhenitsyn, Yu-Lan Feng, and Dorothy Day</p><p>Pelikan collects some 66 articles or excerpts from 19th- and 20th-century literature, anthropology, religion, psychology, theology, and philosophy that touch upon religion and religious experience.

Today, Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody has studied more than a thousand new case&nbsp;&nbsp;histories of adults and children who have clinically&nbsp;&nbsp;reached the point of death and survived, and&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary new research has revealed more patterns&nbsp;&nbsp;of NDEs. Now, for the first time, Dr. Moody&nbsp;&nbsp;presents this wealth of new information to the general&nbsp;&nbsp;public information that uncovers secrets and opens&nbsp;&nbsp;the doors to a powerful message of love from the&nbsp;&nbsp;frontier between life and death.

He has spent 20 years studying the phenomenon, and, in this follow-up study, he presents descriptions of NDE from an impressive number of people who have experienced it. The accounts of supposedly dying and being revived related by adults and children are strikingly similar as are cases here reported by other researchers. Noting that no scientific proof of an afterlife exists, Moody should nonetheless persuade open-minded readers to believe in the possibility and to lobby for further exploration into a new dimension of natural laws.

Seth is the consulting editor for a series of upcoming titles called the &#x201c;Green Guru Guides,&#x201d; which focus on implementing environmentally friendly technologies and making them work for you. <p>Bob Brant was the forward-thinking author of the now classic first edition of <i>Build Your Own Electric Vehicle</i></p>The advantages of electric vehicles (EVs) are well-known: nonpolluting operation, a renewable power source, safety, and low cost of operation. The disadvantages include limitations on speed, operating range, and convenience as well as the high cost of converting existing vehicles to electric operation; while acknowledging such other disadvantages as lack of effective heating, air conditioning, and power steering, EV advocate Brant says some of the best-known ones are myths. Speed, for instance, is related to body weight, and less weight means more speed. (Weight is, however, also a factor in safety: lighter weight often means less safety, especially in collisions, and Brant doesn't mention the collision factor.) Brant provides comprehensive instruction in converting a vehicle to electric power. It is not for the casual hobbyist, though, as is evident in such features as formulas for divining the potential top-end speeds of specific EVs--a precise system to answer questions of speed, but hardly the simple ballpark figure casual readers interested in exploring EVs' possibilities might want. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>There Was a Tree</h2><p>A favorite children's song becomes a colorful book filled with African wildlife <br><br>Also known as "The Green Grass Grew All Around," this popular song has been recorded by artists from Barney to Captain Kangaroo.

Du Bois, Cornel West, and other public intellectuals who confronted the &#34;color line&#34; of the twentieth century, journalist, law professor, and activist Frank H. Wu offers a unique perspective on how changing ideas of racial identity will affect race relations in the new century.Often provocative and always thoughtful, this book addresses some of the most controversial contemporary issues: discrimination, immigration, diversity, globalization, and the mixed-race movement, introducing the example of Asian Americans to shed new light on the current debates. Combining personal anecdotes, social-science research, legal cases, history, and original journalistic reporting, Wu discusses damaging Asian American stereotypes such as &#34;the model minority&#34; and &#34;the perpetual foreigner.&#34; By offering new ways of thinking about race in American society, Wu&#39;s work challenges us to make good on our great democratic experiment.</p><p><i>Yellow</i> by Frank H. Wu is an eclectic, incisive investigation-cum-meditation that, though focusing on Asian Americans, recasts the United States' ongoing debate about racial identity in all forms. Wu suggests that the widespread stereotyping of Asian Americans, while "superficially positive," is inherently damaging. Mixing personal anecdotes, current events, academic studies, and court cases, Wu not only debunks the myth of a "model minority" but also makes discomfiting observations about attitudes toward affirmative action, what he calls "rational" discrimination, mixed marriages, racial profiling, and the "false divisions" of integration versus pluralism and assimilation versus multiculturalism. Though its conclusions are unremarkable, <i>Yellow</i> is thought provoking. The book's strength--besides its clarity and thoughtfulness--is a lack of tendentiousness. Wu prefers to suggest, not posit; muse, not shout; and ask questions, not necessarily answer them. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>Frank H.

Their newest cookbook encourages people to follow their regimen by providing recipes that readers can prepare in 15 minutes or less. Most of these recipes use commonly available ingredients. Even the occasional call for a specialized item, such as silken tofu, no longer presents a problem, since the new nutrition movement has made soy products ubiquitous. Since these recipes eliminate all animal products, vegans will find the book useful, too. An appendix lists commercially processed foods that meet the McDougalls' nutritional standards. Although the authors hold up their diet as a virtual panacea against modern Western civilization's diseases, they do not offer nutritional analyses of the individual recipes, which makes the book much less useful for those with diabetic or other illnesses. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i></p><h2>Psychopharmacology: Straight Talk on Mental Health Medications, Third Edition</h2><p><b>Congratulations to Joe Wegmann, and his book, <i>Psychopharmacology, 3rd Edition,</i> for winning a silver medal at the 2016 IBPA Benjamin Franklin Awards for editorial and design excellence in the Professional &amp; Technical category.</b><br><br>This is the definitive guide and desk reference for healthcare professionals and patients to expand their knowledge in the pharmacological and behavioral treatment of psychosis, anxiety, depression, bipolar, insomnia and ADHD.<br><br>New to the third edition:<br>-DSM-5 and psychotropic medication prescribing<br>-New risk factors with antidepressants<br>-Anxiety treatment -- what should not be medicated<br>-Herbal and other alternative treatments<br>-Latest in geriatric psychopharmacology<br>-Psychotropic medication discontinuation-safe strategies that work<br>-Additive and combination medication protocols<br>-Newly released psychiatric medications<br>-Dosage Range Charts</p><p><b>Joe Wegmann, R.Ph., LCSW</b> is a renowned expert in the field of medication management, with more than 30 years hands-on experience in psychopharmacology and counseling.

She peered out the window and saw the fog dissolving, the microscopic crawl of traffic now materializing on Broadway through the cloud below.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leaning against a bookcase that housed many of the hardcovers she'd guided to publication, Karen shivered. The mention of Andrew's name always unglued her.<br>&nbsp;<br>For two years she'd been romantically involved with the suspense novelist and had even lived with him during the writing of Blue Murder at the same lake house in North Carolina where many of his victims were found.<br>&nbsp;<br>She considered it a latent character defect that she'd failed to notice anything sinister in Andy beyond a slight reclusive tendency.<br>&nbsp;<br>My God, I almost married him.<br>&nbsp;<br>She pictured Andy reading to the crowd in that Boston bookshop the first time they met.

He rode up wishing he'd bought three gyros for lunch instead of two.<br>&nbsp;<br>The doors opened again and he walked onto the twenty-second floor, fishing the key ring containing the master from the pocket of his enormous overalls.<br>&nbsp;<br>He belched.<br>&nbsp;<br>It echoed down the empty corridor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Man, was he hungry.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stopped at 2211, knocked, yelled through the door, "It's the super!"<br>&nbsp;<br>No one answered.<br>&nbsp;<br>Joe Mack inserted the master into the deadbolt. It turned easily enough.<br>&nbsp;<br>He pushed the door open.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hello?" he said, standing in the threshold, admiring the apartment--roomy, flat-screen television, lush deep blue carpet, an antique desk, great view of SoHo, probably loads of food in the fridge.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Anybody home?"<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned the deadbolt four times. It worked perfectly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another door opened somewhere in the hallway and approaching footsteps reverberated off the hardwood floor. Joe Mack glanced down the corridor at the tall man with black hair in a black overcoat strolling toward him from the stairwell.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hey, pal, were you the one who just called me?" Joe Mack asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>The man with black hair stopped at the open doorway of 2211.<br>&nbsp;<br>He smelled strange, of Windex and lemons.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, I was the one."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh. You get the lock to work?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I've never been in this apartment."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What the fuck did you call me for--"<br>&nbsp;<br>Glint of a blade. The man held an ivory-hilted bowie. He swept its shimmering point across Joe Mack's swollen belly, cleaving denim, cotton, several layers of skin.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No, wait just a second--"<br>&nbsp;<br>The man raised his right leg and booted Joe Mack through the threshold.<br>&nbsp;<br>The super toppled backward as the man followed him into the apartment, slammed the door, and shot the deadbolt home.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karen left Ice Blink Press at 6:30 p.m. and emerged into a manic Manhattan evening, the sliver of sky between the buildings smoldering with dying sunlight, gilding glass and steel. It was the fourth Friday of October, the terminal brilliance of autumn full blown upon the city, and as she walked the fifteen blocks to her apartment in SoHo, Karen decided that she wouldn't start the manuscript in her leather satchel tonight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Instead she'd slip into satin pajamas, have a glass of that organic chardonnay she'd purchased at Whole Foods Market, and watch wonderful mindless television.<br>&nbsp;<br>It had been a bad week.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pampering was in order.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At 7:55 she walked out of her bedroom in black satin pajamas that rubbed coolly against her skin. Her chaotic blond hair was twisted into a bun and held up by chopsticks from the Chinese food she'd ordered. Two unopened food cartons and a bottle of wine sat on the glass coffee table between the couch and the flat-screen television. Her apartment smelled of spicy-sweet sesame beef.<br>&nbsp;<br>She plopped down and uncorked the wine.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ashley Chambliss's CD Nakedsongs had ended and in the perfect stillness of her apartment Karen conceded how alone she was.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirty-seven.<br>&nbsp;<br>Single again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Childless.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I'm not lonely, she thought, turning on the television and pouring a healthy glass of chardonnay.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'm just alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a difference.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>After watching <i>Dirty Dancing</i>, Karen treated herself to a soak. She'd closed the bathroom door and a Yankee candle that smelled of cookie dough sat burning in a glass jar on the sink, the projection of its restless flame flickering on the sweaty plaster walls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karen rubbed her long muscular legs together, slippery with bath oil. Imagining another pair of legs sliding between her own, she shut her eyes, moved her hands over her breasts, nipples swelling, then up and down her thighs.<br>&nbsp;<br>The phone was ringing in the living room.<br>&nbsp;<br>She wondered if Scott Boylin was calling to apologize. Wine encouraged irrational forgiveness in Karen. She even wished Scott were in the bathtub with her. She could feel the memory of his water-softened feet gliding up her smooth shinbones. Maybe she'd call and invite him over. Give him that chance to explain. He'd be back from the Doubleday party.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now someone was knocking at the front door.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karen sat up, blew back the bubbles that had amassed around her head.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lifting her wineglass by the stem, she finished it off. Then she rose out of the water, took her white terrycloth bathrobe that lay draped across the toilet seat, and stepped unsteadily from the tub onto the mosaic tile. She'd nearly polished off the entire bottle of chardonnay and a warm and pleasant gale was raging in her head.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karen crossed the living room, heading toward the front door.<br>&nbsp;<br>She failed to notice that the cartons of steamed rice and sesame beef were gone, or that a large gray trashcan now stood between the television and the antique desk she'd inherited from her grandmother.<br>&nbsp;<br>She peeked through the peephole.<br>&nbsp;<br>A young man stood in the hallway holding an enormous bouquet of ruby red roses.<br>&nbsp;<br>She smiled, turned the deadbolt, opened the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I have a delivery for Karen Prescott."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's me."<br>&nbsp;<br>The delivery man handed over the gigantic vase.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Wait here.

Somehow he managed not to lose his grip on the vial, keeping it pressed against his lips until the entire contents had made a fiery progress from his throat to his gut. He convulsed as the pain blossomed, thrashing in the water as it grew, banishing all other sensation, turning his vision grey then black. He wondered if the pain would kill him before Last Look Jack could send a stream of flame down to boil him as he thrashed. Either way he knew with absolute certainty he had barely seconds to live.<br><br>Then it was gone. The pain vanished in an instant. Clay blinked and the black void filling his eyes cleared. He was still in the water, floating weightlessly below a shimmering surface. The water was cold but the chill was muted somehow, a distant thing beyond the confines of his body, a body he quickly realised had grown to huge proportions. The view ahead was a m�lange of colour, cool azure shades shot through with smudges of orange and the occasional small flutters of deep red. <i>They see heat rather than light</i>, Ethelynne Drystone had said when she shared memories with him in the ruined amphitheatre. Once again, he was seeing the world through the eyes of a drake.<br><br>He saw that these colours were not so vibrant as those captured by the doomed Black all those centuries ago, but any sense of limited vision was more than dispelled by the sound that filled his ears. It was a constant vibrating echo, varying in pitch from one second to the next. It meant little to him but he could sense an understanding somewhere in his mind, an instinctive knowledge possessed by the one who had captured this memory. The conclusion was as inescapable as it was terrifying. <i>I'm trancing with Last Look Jack</i>.<br><br>The view shifted as the soundscape changed, a sharp pealing cry cutting through the echo. The shimmering surface above blurred as Clay was propelled through the water, moving with a speed that was beyond any human engine. He could feel the great drake's pulse quicken from a steady, ponderous thrum to a rapid drum-beat as the pealing cry came again. It was plainly a distress call, shot through with panic and terror. Clay could sense Jack's increasing alarm as they raced through the water, the understanding afforded by the trance enabling him to recognise it as parental concern. Somewhere his child was suffering.<br><br>Abruptly the distress call rose to a scream, piercing enough to send a shiver of pain through Clay's mind, then it was gone, cut off in an instant. Another sensation seeped through his consciousness as the scream faded, not a sound this time, a scent. It was a smell that would usually stir hunger in the belly of this monstrous predator, but now stirred only despair. Blood, but not prey to be hunted down or a drifting whale carcass to be scavenged. This was the blood of a Blue drake.<br><br>Last Look Jack gave voice to a cry of his own then, a deep throaty roar of grief that seemed to shake the sea. His speed remained undiminished, however, his massive body coiling with furious energy to propel him on. The scent of blood grew more intense until Clay saw a dark billowing red fog ahead, cooling to pink as the warmth leeched into the water. Jack slowed as he neared the cloud, Clay making out a dark matrix amidst the billowing warmth, a net stretched tight around something large and limp. He could see the dark barbs of several harpoons jutting from the dead Blue, a juvenile judging by its size. Blood bloomed with fresh intensity as the net shifted and the body rolled in its snare as it was drawn up towards the surface. Jack's gaze followed the black lines of the hauling ropes, finding two long dark shapes interrupting the surface above. He knew these shapes, knew they brought danger and normally the sight of them would have caused him to dive for the security of the depths. But not today.<br><br>He tore the net apart first, triangular, razor-like teeth tearing it to pieces, freeing the slaughtered juvenile inside. Jack paused to regard the slowly descending corpse, falling away into the cold black depths in a shroud of blood. A new memory filled Clay's mind. A small Blue struggling free of her mother's womb to coil against her father's massive flanks as he curved his body around them both in a protective embrace, voicing a soft song to soothe her distress.<br><br>The memory faded and Clay found Jack's gaze had returned to the two dark shapes above. He roared again, his despair merging with rage. It was a rare emotion for a Blue, conserved for the mating season and defending territory from aggressive young males. Now it bloomed to unprecedented heights, filling every fibre of Jack's body. Clay felt something give in Jack's mind, a jolting shock that banished his last vestiges of reason. The great Blue's roar died. He had no need to voice his rage now. He was rage.<br><br>The two dark shapes had begun to move, the water on either side of them frothing white and a rhythmic thrum sounding through the ocean. Clay saw soft yellow globes burning in the centre of each shape as the Blue-hunter's engineers stoked them high. Unnerved by the sudden loss of their catch, these sailors had clearly opted not to linger. It wouldn't save them.<br><br>Jack made for the shape on the left, making a steady but unhurried approach from below. Although the rage still boiled in his mind, his predatory instincts held true and he knew the wisdom of preserving his energy for the final rush. When he was some fifty yards from the spinning blades of the Blue-hunter's starboard paddle, he struck. A single thrash of his massive tail shattered the paddle-blades into splinters, causing the ship to veer off in a ragged circle, tilting from the force of Jack's blow. Small, dark figures plunged into the water around him, sailors cast from the deck of the stricken vessel. Jack took his time, snapping each struggling figure in half and spitting out the remnants, finding he disliked the taste of these tiny monsters. Their blood was bitter and their flesh too full of bones. In any case, he was not here to feed.<br><br>He thrashed his tail again, an explosive release of power that propelled him free of the sea. The ship passed beneath him as his massive body soared over it, sailors gaping up at him in terror then screaming as he opened his jaws wide and unleashed a torrent of fire. The flames swept the ship from stern to bow, incinerating men and fittings alike, flooding the holds and setting light to anything that would burn.<br><br>Jack plunged back into the welcoming chill of the ocean, circling the ship as it burned and killing the charred and barely alive sailors peppering the surrounding waters. A sudden, hard vibration pulsed through the sea as something gave in the ship's vitals, probably a stock of gunpowder from the size of the explosion. Jack watched it break in two and slowly subside into the depths, trailing a dark cloud of blood from its sundered holds. The scent of his kin's blood stoked Jack's rage to even greater heights, Clay feeling the already fragile structure of his mind crumble yet further.<br><br>The huge Blue returned to the surface, raising his head above the waves to see a second ship several miles to the north, smoke billowing from her funnels and paddles churning as she piled on the steam. It wouldn't save her.<br><br>The trance fragmented then, Clay experiencing a jolt of pain as the shared memories flitted through his head in a kaleidoscope of wrecked ships and slaughtered sailors. Jack's existence had evidently become an unceasing epic of vengeance, days and nights consumed by the hunt, the endless search for more monsters to kill. He preyed upon whales or giant squid only when his hunger grew into pain; otherwise, he scoured the oceans for ships, destroying all he could find, but there were always more.<br><br>Then came a change, a shift in the torrent of rage and tireless hunting. Jack had shunned the company of his own kind for years, ignoring their songs of greeting whenever he passed close to a pack. He knew on some basic level he was no longer one of them, their songs of bonding and play or the joy of the hunt were echoes of something forever lost; Jack had only one song, the rage song. But then came the day he heard something new, not a plaintive cry drifting through the depths, but a song within his mind.<br><br>Clay felt another jolt of pain as the song enveloped him, alien and dislocating, and yet dreadfully familiar. <i>The White</i>. The depth of malice was unmistakable, although he found it impossible to fully comprehend the intricacies of the beast's thoughts. But he could feel them, the new sense of purpose seeping into Jack's mind, merging with his rage. Clay could sense the Blue struggling against this intrusion. He had a purpose of his own and wanted no other, but the White would not be denied. Soon a fresh torrent of images accompanied the sensation, another ship viewed through the eyes of another Blue. This ship was different however, a warship judging by its guns. Also, it had no paddles. <i>The</i> Superior, Clay realised, watching a young woman raise a pair of revolvers on the deck below. <i>Loriabeth, the day the Blue attacked us</i>.<br><br>The image changed as Loriabeth's bullets struck home, filling it with a red mist that obscured much of what came next, although Clay was able to discern the sudden halt in movement, recalling how he and the Varestian Blood-blessed had used Black to hold the Blue in place whilst Captain Hilemore and Lieutenant Steelfine readied the cannon. There was a flash amidst the red mist and the vision turned instantly to black.<br><br>The sense of purpose flooding Jack's mind altered, becoming an implacable command as the image of the Superior reappeared. This time Clay was able to discern a clear meaning in the White's thoughts: <i>Go south . . . Kill them</i>.<br><br>Clay reeled in shock as Jack's memories swirled around him. <i>It sent him after us. It knew where we were going. How? </i>The answer dawned swiftly, accompanied by a tinge of self-reproach at his failure to realise it sooner. <i>Silverpin</i>. The remnant of her consciousness had been living in his head since her betrayal and death beneath the mountain. <i>It followed her scent, forced poor mad Jack to hunt us down.</i><br><br>Another tumble of memories: Jack finding himself part of a pack once more, although the Blues he swam with sang no songs. The destruction of Kraghurst Station and his repressed but still-evident relish at the sight of so many small monsters burning. Jack chasing the <i>Superior</i> through the channel between the Chokes and the shelf, the crushing weight of the huge wedge of displaced ice bearing him down to the depths, so far down the pressure threatened to crush his mighty body like paper. But he hadn't died, somehow struggling from under the descending weight and straining damaged muscles as he sought the surface. Soon exhaustion claimed him, leaving him limp and drifting on the current. He would have subsided back into the depths had the pack not found him, coming together to bear him up to the surface and the salvation of the air. Still, he was wounded, needing time and sustenance to heal. The other Blues brought walrus and whale-meat, starving themselves so he might eat. Had he still been capable of such things, he would have sung the song of thanks. But they were not truly his pack and such songs were a distant murmur of who he had once been.<br><br>He ate, he healed, he waited, and then came the great upsurge of heat from below, fracturing the ice and allowing him to hunt down the monsters that had wounded him. He marshalled his silent pack, sending them out into the newly sundered ice, ranging far until one found his quarry. A new ship, one with no bloom of heat within its hull, but with monsters roving its deck. Jack, though mad, was far from stupid. Having recently suffered at these creatures' hands, he opted for a more cunning approach, sending his pack to bear the brunt of their terrible, unnatural defences. He watched the sundered, flailing Blue bodies fall one by one, clamping down on his rage, forcing patience into his damaged mind. Only when the last of his pack had slipped into the depths, trailing a cloud of gore from the rent in its neck, did he determine to strike.<br><br>Then a new distraction, a fresh bloom of heat from below accompanied by a great cloud of bubbles as something rushed towards the surface. Jack had no notion of what this thing was, his vision unable to penetrate the hull to discern any heat sources within. But, as it bobbed to the surface and he watched four monsters clamber out, he knew he had found his first easy prey for a long time. A shallow dive then an upward rush was enough to leave the creatures struggling in the water. Jack made for the closest one, grunting in momentary pain as one of the monsters on the ship cast something at him, small but possessed of enough speed to tear a hole in his scales. But it was a familiar sting, his scales bore the scars of many such irritations, and with the prey so close he paid it scant heed.<br><br>The creature struggling in the water below stared up at him with its tiny, bead-like eyes, its claws fumbling for something about its neck. A weapon, perhaps. As if anything so small could threaten him . . .<br><br>Clay watched the image of himself struggling in the water freeze and then shatter, leaving him in a formless, multicoloured fog. Mist swirled around him, coalescing into dense, vibrantly hued clouds then breaking apart. Here and there he caught glimpses of firmer memories, Blue bodies drifting, dismembered sailors, burning ships. This then was the mindscape of Last Look Jack. Beneath the horror Clay could feel a deep weight of confusion pressing in on his own consciousness, shot through with a growing anger.<br><br><i>You can feel me in here, can't you?</i> Clay asked, hoping the drake could discern some meaning in his thoughts. The surrounding mist shimmered, reddish forks of lightning crackling as evidence of Jack's burgeoning rage. <i>Well, you're stuck with me, for now at least. So let's talk.</i></p><h2>The Fourteen Bears in Summer and Winter (Deluxe Golden Book)</h2><p><i>Once upon a time, in a summer forest, there were fourteen bears</i> . . . so begins a sweet story of a bear family&#x2019;s life throughout the year, told in loving and simple detail.

Pirates?"<br> <br> "That is what I said."<br> <br> "You want me to go and work for pirates."<br> <br> O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea, our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free...<br> <br> "My dear Russell, someone your age should not behaving trouble with her hearing." Sherlock Holmes solicitous was Sherlock Holmes sarcastic.<br> <br> "My dear Holmes, someone your age should not be overlooking incipient dementia. Why do you wish me to go and work for pirates?"<br> <br> "Think of it as an adventure, Russell."<br> <br> "May I point out that this past year has been nothing but adventure? Ten back-to-back cases between us in the past fifteen months, stretched over, what, eight countries? Ten, if one acknowledges the independence of Scotland and Wales. What I need is a few weeks with nothing more demanding than my books."<br> <br> "You should, of course, feel welcome to remain here."<br> <br> The words seemed to contain a weight beyond their surface meaning. A dark and inauspicious weight. A Mariner's albatross sort of a weight. I replied with caution. "This being my home, I generally do feel welcome."<br> <br> "Ah. Did I not mention that Mycroft is coming to stay?"<br> <br> "Mycroft? Why on earth would Mycroft come here? In all the years I've lived in Sussex, he's visited only once."<br> <br> "Twice, although the other occasion was while you were away. However, he's about to have the builders in, and he needs a quiet retreat."<br> <br> "He can afford an hotel room."<br> <br> "This is my brother, Russell," he chided.<br> <br> Yes, exactly: my husband's brother, Mycroft Holmes. Whom I had thwarted-blatantly, with malice aforethought, and with what promised to be heavy consequences-scant weeks earlier. Whose history, I now knew, held events that soured my attitude towards him. Who wielded enormous if invisible power within the British government. And who was capable of making life uncomfortable for me until he had tamped me back down into my position of sister-in-law.<br> <br> "How long?" I asked.<br> <br> "He thought two weeks."<br> <br> Fourteen days: 336 hours: 20,160 minutes, of first-hand opportunity to revenge himself on me verbally, psychologically, or (surely not?) physically. Mycroft was a master of the subtlest of poisons-I speak metaphorically, of course-and fourteen days would be plenty to work his vengeance and drive me to the edge of madness.<br> <br> And only the previous afternoon, I had learnt that my alternate lodgings in Oxford had been flooded by a broken pipe. Information that now crept forward in my mind, bringing a note of dour suspicion.<br> <br> No, Holmes was right: best to be away if I could.<br> <br> Which circled the discussion around to its beginnings.<br> <br> "Why should I wish to go work with pirates?" I repeated.<br> <br> "You would, of course, be undercover."<br> <br> "Naturally. With a cutlass between my teeth."<br> <br> "I should think you would be more likely to wear a night-dress."<br> <br> "A night-dress." Oh, this was getting better and better.<br> <br> "As I remember, there are few parts for females among the pirates. Although they may decide to place you among the support staff."<br> <br> "Pirates have support staff?" I set my tea-cup back into its saucer, that I might lean forward and examine my husband's face. I could see no overt indications of lunacy. No more than usual.<br> <br> He ignored me, turning over a page of the letter he had been reading, keeping it on his knee beneath the level of the table. I could not see the writing-which was, I thought, no accident.<br> <br> "I should imagine they have a considerable number of personnel behind the scenes," he replied.<br> <br> "Are we talking about pirates-on-the-high-seas, or piracy-as-violation-of-copyright-law?"<br> <br> "Definitely the cutlass rather than the pen. Although Gilbert might have argued for the literary element."<br> <br> "Gilbert?" Two seconds later, the awful light of revelation flashed through my brain; at the same instant, Holmes tossed the letter onto the table so I could see its heading.<br> <br> Headings, plural, for the missive contained two separate letters folded together. The first was from Scotland Yard. The second was emblazoned with the words, D'Oyly Carte Opera.<br> <br> I reared back, far more alarmed by the stationery than by the thought of climbing storm-tossed rigging in the company of cut-throats.<br> <br> "Gilbert and Sullivan?" I exclaimed."Pirates as in Penzance? Light opera and heavy humour? No. Absolutely not. Whatever Inspector Lestrade has in mind, I refuse."<br> <br> "One gathers," Holmes reflected, reaching for another slice of toast, "that the title originally did hold a double entendre, Gilbert's dig at the habit of American companies to flout the niceties of British copyright law."<br> <br> He was not about to divert me by historical tidbits or an insult against my American heritage: This was one threat against which my homeland would have to mount its own defence.<br> <br> "You've dragged your sleeve in the butter." I got to my feet, picking up my half-emptied plate to underscore my refusal.<br> <br> "It would not be a singing part," he said.<br> <br> I walked out of the room.<br> <br> He raised his voice. "I would do it myself, but I need to be here for Mycroft, to help him tidy up after the Goodman case."<br> <br> Answer gave I none.<br> <br> "It shouldn't take you more than two weeks, three at the most. You'd probably find the solution before arriving in Lisbon."<br> <br> "Why-" I cut the question short; it did not matter in the least why the D'Oyly Carte company wished me to go to Lisbon. I poked my head back into the room. "Holmes: no. I have an entire academic year to catch up on. I have no interest whatsoever in the entertainment of hoipolloi. The entire thing sounds like a headache. I am not going to Lisbon, or even London. I'm not going anywhere.

The book chronicles the launching of the park project, the disputes surrounding its design and management, the job of constructing it, and the various ways it has served generations of New Yorkers. Throughout, the authors delineate the politicians, business people, artists, immigrant laborers, and city dwellers who are the key players in the tale. In tracing the park&#39;s history, the writers also give us the history of New York. They explain how squabbles over politics, taxes, and real estate development shaped the park and describe the acrimonious debates over what a public park should look like, what facilities it should offer, and how it should accommodate the often incompatible expectations of different groups of parkgoers. The authors have uncovered surprising information about the immigrants and African Americans who were displaced from the park site, and they offer a critical reassessment of the famous collaboration of the park&#39;s designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. In rich detail, they describe working-class New Yorkers fighting for Sunday park concerts and against the practice of renting park seats for a nickel. They look back at the origins of the zoo and museums at the park&#39;s borders. They follow the battle between the twentieth-century reformers who wanted to introduce playgrounds and ball fields and the preservationists trying to protect the original Olmsted and Vaux design, and they explain the dramatic changes broughtabout by the social impulses of the New Deal and by Robert Moses. Rounding out the story, the authors take in the park&#39;s recent history: rising fears of crime in the 1950s, the &#34;be-ins&#34; and anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s, the devastating fiscal crisis of the 1970s, and the restoration of the park in the 1980s by the Central Park Conservancy. But the authors&#39; aim is much wider: they also show that conflicting visions of how a park should be managed and used raise larger issues about the meaning of the &#34;public&#34; in a democratic society. Who is the public? How can people take part in making decisions about public institutions? How do we create public space where people of diverse social and cultural backgrounds will feel welcome? These are questions that communities across the nation will continue to debate. Parkgoers and city dwellers everywhere will be enthusiastic readers of The Park and the People, as will those interested in urban, architectural, social, and cultural history, urban planning, and landscape architecture.What took 166 tons of dynamite, six million bricks, 19,000 cubic yards of sand, 20,000 men, and $5 million to build? If you answered New York's Central Park, give yourself a perfect grade. The same is awarded this magnificent public works history, a masterpiece combining the story of the park, the history of New York, city and state politics, and the people of the city. Central Park was conceived in the 1840s, built in the depression era of 1857, and renovated during the Great Depression. The authors have exhausted primary and secondary sources to produce this definitive work, which surpasses an earlier photographic history, Circle of Seasons . From the work of park designers Frederic Law Olmsted and Calbert Vaux to New Deal park commissioner Robert Moses to the administration of Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the volume is a rare combination of scholarship and readable text. The emphasis is on the 19th century and the park's formative decades, including design, property acquisition, and the men whose labor created the world's best-known park. Ignoring neither the vested interests of the propertied class who stood to benefit from the park nor the fear of crime in Central Park, Rosenzweig and Blackmar produce a model history--not just of the park but of the city and people who turn to it for amusement, recreation, relaxation, and more.<br><i>-Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ.

After a long, difficult battle, the Toa are able to defeat the queens of the swarms and end the Bohrok threat ... for now. During the fight, the heroes are transformed into Toa Nuva, with new armor, new weapons, and new Masks of Power.</p></p><p>Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;A graphic novel series based on the LEGO� toy line. In this story, readers learn about the origins of the Toa and their race to save the island of Mata Nui. The evil Makuta has forced the island into a time of despair and evil; those who inhabit it have been waiting to be saved. Then the Toa arrive, ready to fight the villain. As readers progress through the story, they will experience epic battles, dangerous escapes, and treachery among the warriors' ranks. The Toa must capture all of the Masks of Power, and they definitely need to learn to work together as a team if the island is to be saved. The art is vivid and attention grabbing, and the story line, which weaves in Polynesian mythology, is exciting and action-packed. Kids who love Bionicle will definitely be interested in learning about the beginning of these characters. Although battles are fought throughout, the main action is made up of cartoon violence between the Toa and their nemeses.

All rights reserved.The arrival in graphic format of the Bionicle series, Lego&#x2019;s massive saga of cyborgs who defend a tropical island from evil, is sure to be hailed by its fan base as the second coming, which wouldn&#x2019;t be inappropriate given the book&#x2019;s themes. With its mind-tangling twist of religio-mythical cosmology, painfully complex Maori-based names, and an array of characters with nearly indistinguishable personalities, no Bionicle installment is recommended for the uninitiated, and this is far from an exception. This mixture of furious action and dialogue is so ripe with portent that nonfans might actually be turned off from ever reading again, but the undeniable appeal for boys between the ages of 7 and 12 makes this a must-have for the libraries that serve them. Originally printed for the Bionicle Club, the book&#x2019;s combination of specialized vocabulary and bursts of action makes for an irresistible invitation to that group of classically reluctant readers. Not that the readership will particularly care, but the small format hampers the exceptionally precise and vibrant art.

Who could forget Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe in <i>The Big Sleep</i> or Dick Powell playing the same character in <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>?

Now Belue, who teaches history at Murray State University in Kentucky, has transcribed and annotated Draper's rambling manuscript, whose florid, hagiographic prose should not deter readers from some real merits. First, Draper, an indefatigable researcher, drew upon thousands of documents as well as interviews with white, Native American and black frontier dwellers to re-create Boone's colorful exploits, including his blazing of a trail through the Cumberland Gap; his construction of Boonesborough, the first permanent settlement in the "Far West"; and his dramatic rescue of his daughter Jemima and two other girls from Indians. Second, Draper's tome is a treasure trove of early Americana, covering Indian-Anglo wars and relations, the fur trade, the British presence and trans-Appalachian life, flora and fauna. Third, the 76 period drawings, engravings, photographs and maps offer revealing glimpses of both whites and Native Americans. And finally, Belue's entertaining and informative chapter notes diligently correct Draper's romanticization, offering instead a lifelong wanderer from home and family, a failed land speculator, an adventurer who watched his son tortured to death by Cherokees but who still sought accommodation with the Indians. Regrettably, Draper's text breaks off in 1778, but a chronology, epilogue and appendix sketch Boone's later exploits. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Daniel Boone was one of America's earliest frontiersmen, a legend in his own lifetime. Born in Pennsylvania in 1734, he was without schooling; but he learned to read and write phonetically, and he gained enough knowledge of mathematics to do survey work. He began exploring Kentucky in 1769, when he was first guided through the Cumberland Gap by trader John Findley. He helped lay out the Wilderness Road and served as an agent of land development, scout, militia commander, county representative, and judge. An in-depth biography of Boone has never existed until now. Draper, first secretary of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, set out to write this definitive biography in the early 1850s, but after 40 years' work he was unable to finish the task. A century later, Ted Franklin Belue revived the manuscript, edited it, and annotated it. Boone emerges as a genuine leader whose word was his bond, an adopted member of the Shawnee, and a good husband and father. No collection of Americana should be without this long-missing volume. <i>Fred Egloff</i></p><h2>It&#39;s a Wrap II: Sewing New Shapes, Exploring New Techniques</h2><p><p>Start with simple clothesline, wrap it with fabric strips, and coil it into a work of art!

Ruck's attention now falls to the Princess Melanthe, the shrewd, widowed head of the powerful Monteverde family in Italy and to whom he swears allegiance. But Gian, the patriarch of the equally powerful Navona family, plans to marry Melanthe and merge their two kingdoms, and he will murder anyone who jeopardizes his plan. Thirteen years later, Ruck meets Melanthe again and joins the princess's entourage as they journey to reach her estate before Gian catches up with her. On the way, she reveals to Ruck that his wife was burned as a heretic. Melanthe and Ruck exchange wedding vows and consummate the marriage. But the potential repercussions of their union and an advancing plague threaten them, so the two escape to Ruck's estate, which he struggles to reclaim since it was lost through legal confusion. The honeymoon bliss doesn't last long because they have been seen by someone who alerts Gian, who isn't ready to let Melanthe go. Kinsale's ( The Shadow and the Star ) tale is light on vitality and heavy on Middle English, plot twists and tedium. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chronicle of a Plague, Revisited: AIDS and Its Aftermath</h2><p>Andrew Holleran's <i>Ground Zero</i>, first published in 1988 and consisting of 23 <i>Christopher Street</i> essays from the earliest years of the AIDS crisis, was hailed by the <i>Washington Post</i> as one of the best dispatches from the epidemic's height.&#x201d; Twenty years later, with HIV/AIDS long recognized as a global health challenge, Holleran both reiterates and freshly illuminates the devastation wreaked by AIDS, which has claimed the lives of 450,000 gay men as well as 22 million others. <i>Chronicle of a Plague, Revisited</i> features ten pieces never previously republished outside <i>Christopher Street</i>, as well as a new introduction keenly describing and evaluating a historical moment that still informs and defines today's world-particularly its community of homosexuals, which, arguably, is still recovering from the devastation of AIDS.</p><p><b>Andrew Holleran</b> is also the author of a short story collection and four acclaimed novels, <i>Dancer from the Dance</i>, <i>Nights in Aruba</i>, <i>The Beauty of Men</i>, and <i>Grief</i>.

Henry Award winner sold 100,000 copies in paperback. Available for the first time in hardcover, Swimmer in the Secret Sea is the poignant story of how a man and a woman endured the shock and anguish of their newborn baby&#39;s death.</p><p>This novella tells the simple story of Johnny and Diane Laski, a sculptor and his wife, and their attempt to bring a new life into the world, set against the backdrop of a cold Maine winter, deep in the country. In the language of a poet, William Kotzwinkle tells the story of the couple&#39;s quiet night drive to the hospital, their long labor, and their, ultimately, unsuccessful breech birth. Unafraid of his subject, Kotzwinkle destroys any sentimental illusions about the &#34;beauty&#34; of childbirth or the distance of birth from death; he reminds us of how closely the two are intertwined, of the frightening power of the life force, and of the unpredictability and uncanniness of death. And yet, his small book is not without hope: &#34;It&#39;s just the two of us again,&#34; Johnny remarks to his wife as they are returning home from the hospital, and the reader senses that in them the potential for beginning is still alivethe beginning, which, as Plato wrote, &#34;is like a god which as long as it dwells among men saves all things.&#34;William Kotzwinkle is the author of many acclaimed children&#39;s books, including Walter the Farting Dog, Trouble in Bugland, and E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial. His novels and short story collections include The Bear When Over the Mountain, The Fan Man, Fata Morgana, and Doctor Rat. A celebrated author, he is a two-time winner of both the National Magazine Award for Fiction and the World Fantasy Award. He lives with his wife in Maine.</p><h2>Sybil Exposed: The Extraordinary Story Behind the Famous Multiple Personality Case</h2><p>Sybil: a name that conjures up enduring fascination for legions of obsessed fans who followed the nonfiction blockbuster from 1973 and the TV movie based on it&#x2014;starring Sally Field and Joanne Woodward&#x2014;about a woman named Sybil with sixteen different personalities. <i>Sybil </i>became both a pop phenomenon and a revolutionary force in the psychotherapy industry. The book rocketed multiple personality disorder (MPD) into public consciousness and played a major role in having the diagnosis added to the psychiatric bible, <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>. <br><br>But what do we really know about how <i>Sybil </i>came to be? In her news-breaking book <i>Sybil Exposed, </i>journalist Debbie Nathan gives proof that the allegedly true story was largely fabricated. The actual identity of Sybil (Shirley Mason) has been available for some years, as has the idea that the book might have been exaggerated. But in <i>Sybil Exposed, </i>Nathan reveals what really powered the legend: a trio of women&#x2014;the willing patient, her ambitious shrink, and the imaginative journalist who spun their story into bestseller gold. <br><br>From horrendously irresponsible therapeutic practices&#x2014;Sybil&#x2019;s psychiatrist often brought an electroshock machine to Sybil&#x2019;s apartment and climbed into bed with her while administering the treatment&#x2014; to calculated business decisions (under an entity they named Sybil, Inc., the women signed a contract designating a three-way split of profits from the book and its spin-offs, including board games, tee shirts, and dolls), the story Nathan unfurls is full of over-the-top behavior. Sybil&#x2019;s psychiatrist, driven by undisciplined idealism and galloping professional ambition, subjected the young woman to years of antipsychotics, psychedelics, uppers, and downers, including an untold number of injections with Pentothal, once known as &#x201c;truth serum&#x201d; but now widely recognized to provoke fantasies. It was during these &#x201c;treatments&#x201d; that Sybil produced rambling, garbled, and probably &#x201c;false-memory&#x201d;&#x2013;based narratives of the hideous child abuse that her psychiatrist said caused her MPD. <i>Sybil Exposed </i>uses investigative journalism to tell a fascinating tale that reads like fiction but is fact. Nathan has followed an enormous trail of papers, records, photos, and tapes to unearth the lives and passions of these three women. The <i>Sybil </i>archive became available to the public only recently, and Nathan examined all of it and provides proof that the story was an elaborate fraud&#x2014;albeit one that the perpetrators may have half-believed. <br><br>Before <i>Sybil </i>was published, there had been fewer than 200 known cases of MPD; within just a few years after, more than 40,000 people would be diagnosed with it. Set across the twentieth century and rooted in a time when few professional roles were available to women, this is a story of corrosive sexism, unchecked ambition, and shaky theories of psychoanalysis exuberantly and drastically practiced. It is the story of how one modest young woman&#x2019;s life turned psychiatry on its head and radically changed the course of therapy, and our culture, as well.</p><p><b>Debbie Nathan</b> was born and raised in Houston, Texas. She has been a journalist, editor and translator for almost three decades.

Using a fierce blend of investigative journalism and cultural criticism, she exposes multiple personality disorder as yet another lurid myth cooked up by the collective unconscious of our popular culture. The book is an astonishing achievement." -- <b>Steve Almond, author of <i>Candyfreak</i> and <i>God Bless America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Journalist Debbie Nathan -- whose investigative exposure of day care worker Kelly Michaels's wrongful conviction for child molestation did so much to unearth the witch hunts among us -- has found a delicious, hiding-in-plain-sight historical saga to tell: the making of the most famous "multiple personality" case and book. A troubled, impressionable young girl from a Sinclair Lewis-type small town; a brilliant, bullying, female neuropsychiatrist in 1950s Manhattan; and a glamorous, frustrated feminist magazine writer who'd had an affair with Eugene O'Neill Jr.: how these three disparate American women's fates, fantasies, and ambitions came together to create a fiction that rocked the culture and continues to affect us today makes compelling and sobering reading. Who knew this true story existed?! It's as compulsively readable as it is cautionary -- two traits rarely shared in one book.&#x201d;-- <b>Sheila Weller, award winning magazine journalist and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon&#x2014;and the Journey of a Generation</i></b><br><br>"Throughout <i>Sybil Exposed</i>, Nathan traces the winding path from truth to falsehood"--<b>Salon</b><br><br>"A gripping history of crackpot psychiatry" --<b><i>People</i></b> magazine<br><br>"The true story of <i>Sybil</i> has found its ideal historian in Debbie Nathan...This is the book that should be a made-for-TV movie." --<i><b>The Wall Street Journal</b></i><br><br>"A compelling account of the creation, packaging, and selling of this case of medical and journalistic malpractice." --<i><b>Science</b></i><br><br>"In this dazzling expos� of a manipulative psychiatrist, an author who&#x2019;d do anything for fame and a vulnerable girl caught in the middle, journalist Nathan reveals how these three women changed the psychiatric landscape by raising questions of identity that resonated with a generation.

The result was Esperanto, a utopian scheme full of the brilliance, craziness, and grandiosity that characterize all such messianic visions.</p><p>In this first full history of a constructed language, poet and scholar Esther Schor traces the life of Esperanto. She follows the path from its invention by Zamenhof, through its turn-of-the-century golden age as the great hope of embattled cosmopolites, to its suppression by nationalist regimes and its resurgence as a bridge across the Cold War. She plunges into the mechanics of creating a language from scratch, one based on rational systems that would be easy to learn, politically neutral, and allow all to speak to all. Rooted in the dark soil of Europe, Esperanto failed to stem the continent's bloodletting, of course, but as Schor shows, the ideal continues draw a following of modern universalists dedicated to its visionary goal.</p><p>Rich and subtle, <i>Bridge of Words</i> is at once a biography of an idea, an original history of Europe, and a spirited exploration of the only language charged with saving the world from itself.</p></p><p><b>Esther Schor</b> is the author of <i>Emma Lazarus</i>, which received a 2006 National Jewish Book Award, and <i>Bearing the Dead: The British Culture of Mourning from the Enlightenment to Victoria</i>. A poet and essayist, she has written two volumes of poems, <i>Strange Nursery</i> and <i>The Hills of Holland</i>, and a memoir, <i>My Last JDate</i>.

A professor of English at Princeton University, Schor lives in Princeton, New Jersey.<p>&#x201c;Esther Schor&#x2019;s lovely book describes how a tenacious group of people have dedicated themselves to an optimistic vision of harmony. It is a meditation not only on Esperanto, but on idealism itself, and it is written with resonant clarity, abiding kindness, and great compassion.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Andrew Solomon</b>, author of <i>Far From the Tree</i></p><p>&#x201c;Esther Schor has crossed continents, tunneled under the Tower of Babel, brooded over the twentieth century&#x2019;s darkest traumas and brightest dreams, and spoken endless Esperanto in an effort to understand how a language freighted with human tragedy still lives like a kiss on the lips of its speakers. This is a beautiful, mysteriously moving book by a fearless writer who set out to find the soul of a language, knowing full well that it was her own soul she was after all along.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Jonathan Rosen</b>, author of <i>Joy Comes in the Morning</i></p><p>&#x201c;Esther Schor brings a scholar&#x2019;s rigor and a poet&#x2019;s ear to the astonishing, century-long story of Esperanto, from its Jewish inventor in nineteenth-century Poland to its fractious, worldwide devotees today. Tracing this utopian tale philosophically, politically, and personally, like a sympathetic yet clear-eyed analyst, she interprets the recurring dream of a universal language, revealing its meaning for our lives today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b>Alisa Solomon</b>, author of <i>Wonder of Wonders</i></p></p><h2>Children of Henry VIII</h2><p>At his death in 1547, King Henry VIII left four heirs to the English throne: his only son, the nine-year-old Prince Edward; the Lady Mary, the adult daughter of his first wife Katherine of Aragon; the Lady Elizabeth, the teenage daughter of his second wife Anne Boleyn; and his young great-niece, the Lady Jane Grey. In her brilliantly compelling new book, Alison Weir, author of four highly acclaimed chronicles of English royalty, paints a unique portrait of these four extraordinary rulers, examining their intricate relationships to each other and to history.<br><br>Weir opens her narrative with the death of Henry and the accession of the boy king Edward VI. Often portrayed as weak and sickly, Edward, in fact had a keen intelligence and a flair for leadership. Had he not contracted a fatal disease at the age of fifteen, Edward might have become one of England's great kings. Instead, his brief reign was marked by vicious court intrigue that took the monarchy to the verge of bankruptcy.<br><br>Edward's death in 1553 plunged England into chaos, and it was in this explosive atmosphere that the ill-fated Lady Jane Grey was crowned Queen of England. A fragile, intellectual girl, Jane was only too happy to end her nine-day rule when the rioting English populace proclaimed Mary their true and rightful sovereign. Despite her innocence, Jane was brutally executed at the age of sixteen.<br><br>Mary's reign was marked by her savage persecution of heretics (non-Catholics) and by the emotional turbulence of her marriage to King Philip II of Spain. Weir describes the mounting tensions of the final days of Mary's bloody reign, as the shrewd, politically adroit Elizabeth quietly positions herself to assume royal power. The Children of Henry VIII closes with Elizabeth's accession and the commencement of one of the longest, and most spectacularly successful, reigns in English history.<br><br>Deeply engrossing, written with grace and clarity, The Children of Henry VIII combines the best of history and biography. Weir's devoted readers will recognize this as her finest book yet.</p><p>The royal family may have its problems these days, but as Alison Weir reminds us in this cohesive and impeccably researched book, the nobility of old England could be both loveless and ruthless. Weir, an expert in the period and author of a book on Henry&#39;s VIII wives, focuses on the children of Henry VIII who reigned successively after his death in 1547: Edward VI, Mary I (&#34;Bloody Mary&#34;) and Elizabeth I. The three shared little--living in separate homes--except for a familial legacy of blood and terror. This is exciting history and fascinating reading about a family of mythic proportions.Alison Weir succeeds in doing what very few writers of history ever have -- she makes it live. Her unraveling of the intricate intrigues and power-plays that surrounded Henry's unfortunate children Mary, Elizabeth and Edward -- and his young heir Lady Jane Grey reads like a suspense novel. This is history as it should be written. <br>--Margaret Sanborn/Publicity</p><h2>Standard Candles: The Best Short Fiction of Jack McDevitt</h2><p>Sixteen outstanding stories by Hugo and Nebula-award nominee, Jack McDevitt. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Contents: Standard Candles Tidal Effects Translations from the Colosian Black to Move The Fort Moxie Branch Promises to Keep Gus To Hell with the Stars Ellie The Jersey Rifle Cruising Through Deuteronomy Tyger Auld Lang Boom Dutchman Cryptic Time Travelers Never Die BACK COVER: McDevitt's tales have an emotional resonance that lingers well after the book has been set aside. Standard Candles is a strong, strong collection. -Cemetery Dance <p>Always engaging and insightful, McDevitt can be counted on to ask the deep questions. - David Brin </p><p>Jack McDevitt is one of those rare science fiction writers capable of taking the tropes of the field - from war and the military to alien contact to scripture vs. science - and breathing wonderful life into them. He's always a pleasure to read. - Gregory Frost </p><p>It's not McDevitt's style, though his prose is wonderfully clear and deceptively simple. It's not his plots, though his stories always ask hard questions, and never settle for easy answers. For me it's his humanity. McDevitt understands the way people talk and think and behave, and still somehow has boundless compassion for the human animal. - Lewis Shiner </p><p>In both his novels and his short fiction, Jack McDevitt has shown a terrific range of skills and imagination and speculation. Only one thing remains the same from piece to piece to piece - they're all damn fine stories. - Kevin J. Anderson </p><p>Jack McDevitt is a master of the short story form. - Kathleen Ann Goonan </p><p>The ideal writer can stretch your mind with a wonderful concept while also touching your heart with a personal story. Most of us fail at one or the other, but from the very beginning of his career Jack McDevitt has shown that he can do both. - Michael Cassutt </p><p>You hold in your hand some of the best work of one of our best writers. Enjoy! - James Patrick Kelly </p><p>McDevitt is the real thing: a writer with depth, integrating scientific issueswith human concerns on a vast stage, lit by vivid colors. - Gregory Benford </p><p>Jack McDevitt is one of the few authors in contemporary science fiction whose work moves faultlessly from scientic speculation to speculations on the nature of reality and the human condition. McDevitt fashions fully realized worlds, rich in imagination, peopled by fully believable characters. More important, you can count on him for a damn fine read. - Bruce Boston </p><p>It's high time indeed for a Jack McDevitt story collection! McDevitt writes with wisdom, compassion, and an abiding sense of wonder - everything that has drawn me again and again to the worlds of science fiction - real people with real concerns, in extraordinary settings.If you haven't read this man's work, start now! - Jeffrey A. Carver </p><p>Long after you've closed this book,the stories will stay in your mind and in your heart. - Karen Joy Fowler </p><p>It has long been a landmark in a science fiction writer's career when a publisher decides it is time to publish a collection of his or her best short fiction. Once upon a time, the publishers who did such things were mass market paperback houses. Today they are largely (not exclusively) small presses that market to the dedicated SF audience. NESFA Press is a good example; it collects work of Boskone guests of honor. So is Tachyon Publications, as it demonstrates with Standard Candles: The Best Short Fiction of Jack McDevitt. </p><p>McDevitt has done a number of very interesting novels, of which the last two were The Engines of God and Ancient Shores. The short fiction has been accumulating for years - clever, insightful, often marked by oddly inconclusive endings, and quite neglected in the sense of fame, fortune, and awards. Two of the sixteen stories thus ring of personal revelance: the title story concerns an astronomer who, though he has never flared as brightly as a nova has had a long and glowing career; "The Fort Moxie Branch" offers the notion of a future library that preserves the work of neglected writers and materializes rather like an Isher weapons shop to offer afirmation when a writer needs it most. "Auld Lang Boom" is the butterfly whose wings cause hurricanes - everytime two old friends meet, something awful happens in the world; the surviving heir of one, reading the diary left behind, gets quite spooked. "Cryptic" is the tale of closing down a SETI operation and finding the files of an old computer disk with frightening implications. "Time Travelers Never Die" plays fast and loose with continuity when even after death a time traveler is able to maintain contact with his lover. "The Jersey Rifle" concerns the discovery of the world's greatest chess player, an unassuming druggist who can beat anyone. And more. - Analog</p></p><p>Jack McDevitt may be best known for his novels, but it was with the short story form that he proved his mettle for years inside the pages of the top science fiction magazines. This edition brings together for the first time sixteen of McDevitt's greatest tales. It is here where the full extent of McDevitt's talent is at last on display.McDevitt first rose to prominence with the publication of his short story, "Cryptic," in the April 1983 edition of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. This story of alien contact and war between the stars was widely anthologized and was a Nebula Award finalist. His first novel, The Hercules Text, also dealt with the discovery of an alien race. Published as part of Terry Carr's Ace Science Fiction Specials, the same series that launched the careers of Lucius Shepard, Kim Stanley Robinson, and William Gibson, The Hercules Text won the 1986 Special Philip K. Dick Award. <p>But it wasn't until his third novel, The Engines of God, that McDevitt emerged as one of science fiction's top novelists. Like Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, The Engines of God concerned itself with the wonders of interstellar anthropology. McDevitt's descriptions of translated fragments of alien writings and his portrayal of alien artwork were wrung with a poetic authenticity that was at once beautiful and mysterious. In Standard Candles, more wonders abound. All are presented with the lucidity and grace that have become McDevitt's trademarks.</p>Jack McDevitt is the author of six novels, and a subsequent number of memorable short stories. He has won the $10,000 UPC International prize for science fiction novellas and has been nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula. He has been a taxi driver, a naval officer, a customs inspector, an English teacher, and a motivational trainer for managers. He lives in south Georgia with his wife Maureen and three children.</p><h2>The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth</h2><p>Sometime this century the day will arrive when the human influence on the climate will overwhelm all other natural factors. Over the past decade, the world has seen the most powerful El Ni�o ever recorded, the most devastating hurricane in two hundred years, the hottest European summer on record, and one of the worst storm seasons ever experienced in Florida. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. <i>The Weather Makers</i> is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Along with a riveting history of climate change, Tim Flannery offers specific suggestions for action for both lawmakers and individuals, from investing in renewable power sources like wind, solar, and geothermal energy, to offering an action plan with steps each and every one of us can take right now to reduce deadly CO2 emissions by as much as 70 percent.</p><p>"Like Jared Diamond and Stephen Jay Gould, Tim Flannery has the ability to take complex ideas and - seemingly effortlessly - make them accessible. This book captures your imagination through its extraordinary range of argument, its vivid imagery, its wealth of research, quick wit and richness of detail. It succeeds where equally worthy but more prosaic recent books have failed.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1983</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A small handgun, six hollow-point, .25 calibre cartridges, a plastic bag, and an open jar of Vaseline lay on top of the chipped enamel toilet tank. Erin O&#x2019;Byrne disassembled the revolver, slipped its components and the bullets inside the bag, and tied a short length of white string round the neck. She shuddered as she scooped Vaseline from the jar and lubricated the package.</p> <p>Someone hammered on the door.</p> <p>Erin almost dropped the bag.</p> <p>&#x201c;Get a move on.&#x201d; She heard the tension in her brother&#x2019;s voice.</p> <p>&#x201c;Christ, Cal, you near scared me to death.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be late.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Take your hurry in your hand.&#x201d; She put one foot on the toilet seat and reached under her skirt. The plastic was cold against her. She spread herself with her left hand and worked at the slippery bag, feeling it slide into her. The stiff gun barrel could have been Eamon&#x2014;she felt the familiar tingle&#x2014;but the bag was cold and, God knew, Eamon was always so hot. Used to be&#x2014;until the Brit bastards lifted him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Move it, Erin.&#x201d;</p> <p>She lowered her skirt, washed her hands, and opened the door.</p> <p>&#x201c;What the hell are you getting yourself worked up for? I&#x2019;m the one that&#x2019;s taking the risks. I&#x2019;m the one going into the Kesh.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Sited on a disused aerodrome outside Lisburn, &#x2018;the Kesh&#x2019; had been called Long Kesh in 1974 when the Security Forces sent Davy McCutcheon down. They hadn&#x2019;t thrown the book at him. They&#x2019;d chucked the whole bloody Linen Hall Library. Fifteen years for arms possession. Arms possession. Christ, he&#x2019;d been the best bloody Provo bomb maker in Belfast. They&#x2019;d given him another twenty-five for what they&#x2019;d called the murder of the British soldier Davy&#x2019;d shot while trying to escape from a farmhouse in Ravernet&#x2014;not ten miles from where he lay in his cell.</p> <p>Murder, my Aunt Fanny Jane, Davy thought. In his mind and in the opinion of the Provisional IRA, the Provos, the Brit squaddie had got his in a legitimate military operation. The Brits had been tipped off that the Provos were planning to mount an attack from the farmhouse. Soldiers had launched a raid and trapped Davy there. Davy hadn&#x2019;t even known at the time that he&#x2019;d killed a soldier.</p> <p>While the man Davy&#x2019;d thought he could trust&#x2014;a man who called himself Mike Roberts&#x2014;had been downstairs, greeting the attackers under his real name, Lieutenant Marcus Richardson, the bastard who&#x2019;d given the fucking Brits the tip-off, one member of the British attack group had rushed up to the bedroom where Davy was hidden. He&#x2019;d let go a blind burst of automatic fire through the locked door. Heard the thump of a falling body. That was all. Davy&#x2019;d been too busy trying, and failing, to blow up a bridge over the Ravernet River and, with it, the then British prime minister, Harold Wilson.</p> <p>Today, Maggie Thatcher was prime minister, the Beatles were history, Bob Geldof was all the rage, the Troubles were into their fourteenth year&#x2014;and Davy was nine years older.</p> <p>Bloody good thing the Brits hadn&#x2019;t tried to nail him for Richardson&#x2019;s death, too. Someone <i>had</i> shot the young man, but Davy had to give the authorities their due. Their forensic experts had shown the bullet that killed him could not have been fired by Davy&#x2019;s weapon. They&#x2019;d concluded Richardson must have stopped a random shot when the soldier Davy <i>had</i> killed loosed off a burst as he fell.</p> <p>That had been nine years ago. Nine fucking years, and it wasn&#x2019;t even half of his sentence. The twenty-five years they&#x2019;d given him for murder were to be served in full without any chance for parole. He could earn remission time for the arms-possession charge, but by his reckoning the twenty-first century would have arrived before he was on the outside&#x2014;unless the Brits declared an amnesty or the Provos won the bloody war. He was going to be in the Kesh for a long time.</p> <p>When he&#x2019;d first arrived, the prison was a collection of Nissen huts surrounded by barbed wire cages. The Brits had replaced the corrugated iron structures with eight pairs of single-storey concrete cell blocks, each pair joined by a central corridor&#x2014;the H blocks. Each block housed 160 prisoners and was surrounded by its own thirty-foot, barbed-wire-topped fence. The entire complex lay behind a twenty-foot-high, antiscale perimeter wall. The perimeter wall was anywhere from half to one mile from the H blocks. There&#x2019;d be no &#x201c;great escape&#x201d; by tunnel.</p> <p>The British changed the name from Long Kesh to the Maze. The Republicans still called the place the Kesh or the Lazy K, as if it were an American ranch. They were good at that kind of sarcastic naming. A huge housing development on the outskirts of Belfast might be called Turf Lodge by the city planners. To its Republican inhabitants, it was known as the Ponderosa after the Cartwrights&#x2019; spread in the TV series <i>Bonanza</i>.</p> <p>Davy had lived&#x2014;if you could call it living&#x2014;in cell 16, D wing, H-block 7, through the weeks of the &#x201c;blanket men,&#x201d; Provisional IRA inmates who, demanding the right to be treated as political prisoners, not criminals, had refused to wear prison uniforms. They spent their days naked, draped only in blankets. Davy, although sympathetic, had ignored the suggestions from the Provos&#x2019; internal command that he should &#x201c;go on the blanket.&#x201d;</p> <p>Even in here there was a strict hierarchy that had nothing to do with the Brits. Each cell block had its own commander, who in turn reported to an overall Provo officer commanding the Kesh. Inmates were meant to &#x201c;obey all orders and regulations issued&nbsp;&#x2026; by the Army authorities and&nbsp;&#x2026; commanding officers.&#x201d; That was part of the <i>�glaigh na h�irann</i> declaration he had made when he had joined the IRA as a boy.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d believed back then. God, he&#x2019;d believed. Wouldn&#x2019;t any sixteen-year-old whose father had fought against the British in the Black and Tan war in the &#x2019;20s, whose father ate, drank, and slept Irish independence&#x2014;the Cause? But now? One of Davy&#x2019;s bombs, one he had planted himself with an army patrol as its target, had accidentally killed a farmer and his family, and Davy had been forced to watch as a little girl was roasted alive in the furnace that had been their car. After that, his faith in the Provos and their goal of Irish freedom was shattered.</p> <p>Jesus, he thought, if I was a priest, the rest of the true believers would consider me an apostate. He didn&#x2019;t give a shite what anyone thought.</p> <p>Davy had told the self-important little git who thought he ran cell-block H to go fuck himself, and when the blanket men upped the ante with the Dirty Protest, Davy had not been one of the 341 Republican inmates who had stayed in their cells for three years, unwashed, unshaven, with their uneaten food and excreta daubed on the walls. The place was bad enough without having to live with the stink of your own shite.</p> <p>By then, even the Provo Officer Commanding the Kesh had got the message. Davy McCutcheon wanted nothing to do with any of his 850 fellow prisoners, was putting in his time and that was that. When the hunger strikes started in 1981, no one had bothered to suggest to Davy that he, like Bobby Sands and eight other prisoners, should starve himself to death.</p> <p>He lay on his cast-iron cot as the screws made their morning rounds, clattering their billy clubs on the doors of the cells. He stared at the walls. Christ, he knew every crack in the cement, reckoned he could call the spiders that infested the walls by name.</p> <p>He watched as his cell mate rose. Eamon Maguire from County Tyrone was twenty-nine, another lifer caught after a shootout when two Royal Ulster Constabulary men had been killed. Eamon had been in for three years. The day Maguire&#x2019;d arrived, Davy had recognized the man for what he was. Tough as an old boot, deeply committed to the Cause, but once in a while he let his friendly side show. In their first year together, Eamon had broken through Davy&#x2019;s reticence, called the older man Father Davy, and asked Davy&#x2019;s advice but didn&#x2019;t always take it. Eamon had paid no heed when Davy had tried to warn him off getting mixed up in the circle of that really hard shite, Brendan McGuinness.</p> <p>McGuinness. Davy shook his head. As Officer Commanding the 1st Battalion, Belfast Brigade, Provisional Irish Republican Army, McGuinness had been the man behind the raid that had cost Davy his freedom. He was a man Davy avoided. Detested. Served the hoor right that he&#x2019;d been lifted at the same time as Davy. The pair of them had unfinished business&#x2014;a lot of unfinished business&#x2014;and it was a bloody good thing that McGuinness was in C wing, not in a cell near Davy.</p> <p>McGuinness was a bitter man, a vengeful man who reveled in the violence of the Troubles. When they had been working together on the outside, Davy had seen through McGuinness&#x2019;s protestations of love for Ireland. He was in the Provos because that gave legitimacy to his love of killing and maiming. And he had treated Davy like a has-been old idiot, someone who was expendable, had even told Davy on one of the rare occasions that they had come face-to-face in here that it served him right that he&#x2019;d been captured. That he was a liability to the Provos anyway. It had taken three men to pull Davy off McGuinness. Bastard.</p> <p>Davy threw back the blanket and swung his legs over the side of the cot. He rubbed his left thigh. The ache was always with him. His thighbone had snapped when Davy had jumped from that farmhouse window. Three hundred yards from the Ravernet Bridge, and one hundred yards from the motorbike that would have got him away. If his fucking leg hadn&#x2019;t given way, he&#x2019;d be in Canada now with Fiona.</p> <p>No use crying over spilt milk, he told himself, and recognized the lie for what it was. Not a day went by that he didn&#x2019;t think of her and what might have been.</p> <p>&#x201c;Time you were up, Father Davy.&#x201d; Eamon, carrot-red haired with two front teeth missing, grinned and flicked a towel in Davy&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not likely the screws&#x2019;ll be bringing you breakfast in bed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Away off and chase yourself, son.&#x201d; It was good to have Eamon for a friend, the only friend Davy had in the whole bloody place&#x2014;in the whole bloody world. His best mate from the old days, Jimmy Ferguson, lived in Canada. He did write, but it wasn&#x2019;t the same as the pair of them sitting together over a pint, having a bit of <i>craic</i>, the banter so ingrained in the Irish character, Jimmy spouting the lines of his hero, William Butler Yeats:</p> <p><i>Romantic Ireland&#x2019;s dead and gone,</i></p> <p><i>It&#x2019;s with O&#x2019;Leary in the grave.</i></p> <p>Aye, or with Davy McCutcheon in the fucking Kesh.</p> <p>Eamon said something.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll shave first. Erin&#x2019;s coming today. I want to get my breakfast early.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;</p> <p>Davy half paid attention as Eamon brushed his teeth, filled the cracked enamel basin, lathered his face, and shaved with a safety razor. Cutthroats were not permitted. He heard the water run out and Eamon refilling the basin.</p> <p>&#x201c;There you are. Room service.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Piss off,&#x201d; Davy said, but limped to the basin. He had to stoop to look in the mirror. Whoever had hung it had not made any allowance for a man who stood six feet tall. He shaved carefully, peering at the face that looked back at him, blotched in the places where the silvering had peeled from the back of the glass. He saw a pair of deep blue eyes, crow&#x2019;s-feet at the corners, and it wasn&#x2019;t constant smiling that had put those lines there. His moustache, trimmed over firm lips, showed not a trace of its original black. All silver now like his thinning thatch. He still carried a scar over his left eyebrow, a reminder of the head-butt from a drunken youth in a Republican drinking club.</p> <p>Eamon said, &#x201c;Hand me that wee glass.&#x201d;</p> <p>Davy lifted a water-filled tumbler from a shelf between the basin and the mirror and gave it to Eamon.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ta.&#x201d; He removed a dental plate from the water, gave it a quick rinse, popped it into his mouth, and grinned at Davy. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Got to look my best for Erin.&#x201d; As he left the cell, Davy heard Eamon say in a stage whisper, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s bringing me a wee present.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Erin felt the string of her &#x201c;wee present&#x201d; rub against the inside of her thigh. Maybe she&#x2019;d left the cord too long, but how else was she to get the package out? Eamon had told her that other women smuggled things&#x2014;a miniature camera, messages stuffed in the top halves of ballpoint pens&#x2014;and for all she knew others might be in the gunrunning business, but, Jesus, Mary, and Jo, why had she let Eamon talk her into this?</p> <p>She squeezed the steering wheel until her knuckles whitened. The drive from Tyrone to the Kesh seemed to be taking forever. At least she was off the narrow winding roads of County Tyrone and on the M1 Motorway. She just wanted to get to the prison, get this over with, and get home.</p> <p>She knew that she would be body searched. What would the female prison officer think when she saw that Erin was not wearing panties? She felt the blush start. The embarrassment would be desperate. Then Erin smiled. Typical Catholic girl. Here&#x2019;s me taking the biggest risk of my life, and what I&#x2019;m really worried about is that my mammy always told me that nice girls would never go out without their undies on.</p> <p>When it worked out the way Eamon said it would, she&#x2019;d soon be wearing a lot less than just no knickers. And there&#x2019;d be something inside her a lot nicer than her wee bag and its cold contents.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Eamon wriggled in his chair in the visiting area. Erin was late. Christ, if the screws had found what she was bringing, it would fuck up two years of planning. And that didn&#x2019;t bear thinking about. He&#x2019;d been in on it almost from the start because of his expertise with firearms. The Provo Officer Commanding in the Kesh, Bic McFarlane, had approached Eamon last year. Without preamble, he&#x2019;d asked, &#x201c;Could you fix one of those wee .25 pistols if it was busted?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye, certainly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fix that.&#x201d; McFarlane threw the components of a small revolver onto the table in Eamon&#x2019;s cell.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fucking&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know what it is. Fix it.&#x201d;</p> <p>It had only taken a minute to reassemble the weapon.</p> <p>&#x201c;Keep your mouth shut about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Eamon bristled. &#x201c;Of course I fucking well will. What do you take me for?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A sound man, or I&#x2019;d not be here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One day a bunch of us are getting out, and you&#x2019;ll be coming with us, but only a few of the lads know. So not a fucking word. Not to nobody. Right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; Out? Dead on. Eamon hugged the thought.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me or Bobby Storey&#x2019;ll be in touch.&#x201d; McFarlane put the revolver into his pocket.</p> <p>Eamon, who was in no doubt about the need for security&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t even tell Davy&#x2014;had been willing to wait, as he waited now, and wished to God Erin would get a move on.</p> <p>The Provos weren&#x2019;t the only security-conscious lot in this place, but Eamon knew that security&#x2019;s only as good as those who try to make it work, and for two years the Provo inmates had been working at undermining the prison warders. He had gradually learned the intricacies of the planning. He thought back as he waited.</p> <p>The first step had been to ensure that one H block, H-7, was rid of any Loyalist prisoners. The Provo leadership had deliberately provoked fights with the Protestant bastards. Not one was in H-7 now. Good riddance to bad rubbish.</p> <p>Then Bic McFarlane and his mates had put pressure on the Northern Ireland Office to let the prisoners work, maybe get back some of the remission time that they&#x2019;d lost during the blanket protest. For a year, many of the men of H-7 had worked as orderlies....</p></p><h2>Walls of My Heart</h2><p>Powerful Keys to Breaking Out and Being Free.</p><p></p><h2>Managing Contraceptive Pill/Drug Patients</h2><p>15th edition of Dickey book</p><p></p><h2>The Lost World of James Smithson: Science, Revolution, and the Birth of the Smithsonian</h2><p><p>In 1836 the United States government received a strange and unprecedented gift&#x2015;a half-million dollar bequest to establish a foundation in Washington "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men." The Smithsonian Institution, as it would be called, eventually grew into the largest museum and research complex in the world. Yet the man behind what became "America's attic," James Smithson, has remained a shadowy figure for more than 150 years. </p><p>Drawing on unpublished diaries and letters from across Europe and the United States, historian Heather Ewing tells his compelling story in full. The illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland, Smithson was the youngest member of Britain's Royal Society and a talented chemist admired by the greatest scientists of his age. At the same time, however, he was also a suspected spy, an inveterate gambler, and a radical revolutionary during the turbulent years of the Napoleonic Wars. But at the heart of Smithson's story is his bequest&#x2015;worth $9 million in today in today's currency&#x2015;which sparked an international lawsuit and a decade-long congressional battle, featuring a dizzying cast of historical figures, including John Quincy Adams, and Alexander Graham Bell, both of whom grappled with how&#x2015;and even whether&#x2015;to put Smithson's endowment to use. </p><p>Fascinating and magisterial, Ewing's biography presents a sweeping portrait of a remarkable man at the center of the English Enlightenment and the creation of America's greatest museum.</p></p><p><p><b>Heather Ewing </b>is an architectural historian. She has worked for the Smithsonian and the Ringling Museum of Art. She lives in New York.</p>This pleasing biography (the second recent one of Smithson, after 2003's <i>The Stranger and the Statesman</i> by Nina Burleigh) tells the story of the enigmatic Englishman who left the United States a vast sum of money to found "an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge." Ewing, an architectural historian who has worked at the Smithsonian, traces John Smithson's development as a "gentleman-scientist," describing his study of chemistry at Oxford in the 1780s; his membership in the Coffee House Philosophical Society, where learned men discussed scientific news; and his well-received scientific papers. Two of the most fascinating chapters focus on Smithson's will. Ewing hazards a few suggestions about why an English scientist would leave a huge bequest to the United States government, and she examines the controversy Smithson's gift set off&#x2014;some argued against accepting what they viewed as Smithson's self-aggrandizing bequest. This book is possible only because Ewing is a dogged researcher in countless archives. References to Smithson in his friends' letters and diaries reveal not the dour recluse historians had once thought him to be but an exuberant if eccentric man with a zeal for learning and for life. Ewing ably conveys all this as well as the mysterious roots of the institution that bears his name. Illus. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vesuvius only days before the volcano was set to erupt. Ancient Rome at its pulpiest. Who knew aqueducts could be so sexy? <em>The Ghost Writer</em> (winner of the 2008 International Thriller Writers award for Best Novel) claims the shadowy world of contemporary North Atlantic politics as its subject. Classy Brit espionage best enjoyed with a gin and tonic in hand. All were international bestsellers. All were page-turners non-pareil. But best, all were frighteningly intelligent. Thrillers that made you think as you maddeningly bit your nails.</p> <p>With <i>The Fear Index</i>, Mr. Harris has turned his gimlet eye on the secret world of billion dollar hedge funds, namely those that seek to earn profits by computer driven program trading. The result is a wholly unique entertainment: a strange, compelling, and utterly propulsive novel. I&#x2019;m not sure who would enjoy it more: George Soros, Arthur C. Clarke or Edgar Allen Poe. </p> <p>The story takes place over a tumultuous twenty-four hour period in the life of Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, computer scientist, mathematical genius, and, of late, hedge fund billionaire. It begins (as a fine thriller should) on a dark and stormy night when Hoffmann is awoken by an intruder inside his sixty million dollar villa on the shores of Lake Geneva. A confrontation occurs, Hoffmann is injured, and in his attempt to solve just how someone was able to gain entry into his well-guarded palace, Hoffmann comes face to face with the greatest danger he can imagine: himself. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s more accurate to say: his intellect. To reveal more would ruin the adventure...and adventure it is. </p> <p>There is, however, a backstory. Hoffmann was not always a stock trader. He began his career as a computer scientist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) where his work in artificial intelligence involved modeling sophisticated algorithms that programmed computers to teach themselves. It is this mastery of algorithms, and how they train computers to mimic human behavior, that he has turned to such profitable use at Hoffmann Investment Technologies. And it is this mastery that will come to haunt him. </p> <p>What Harris does so admirably--in my mind, better than any other writing today--is intertwine nifty, page turning plots with important historical, political, or in this case, sociological questions. The late Michael Crichton did this kind of story well. In <i>The Fear Index</i>, Robert Harris does it fantastically. </p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <b>Fatherland</b>, <b>Enigma</b>, <b>Archangel</b>, <b>Pompeii</b>, <b>Imperium </b>and <b>The Ghost</b>, all of which were international bestsellers.

She has had over twenty-five years of success as a novelist.In a contemporary spin on the concept of biblical "covenant" that also functions as a parable of accepting and rejecting faith, Blackstock offers a smooth though somewhat improbable tale of one woman's promise to her husband to care for her stepchildren. Kara Holbrooke and her twin sister, Lizzie, lived a middle-class existence with their doting father, Jack, who nixed a life of moneyed pleasure despite his father's wealth. Shortly after their birth, the twins' mother, Sherry, died in a car accident. When the girls were three, Jack married Amanda, but six months after the wedding, he and his parents were killed in a plane crash. The twins are easy prey maybe too easy for Sherry's redneck parents, Eloise and Deke Krebbs, who smell money and go to court to claim the girls as their own. Amanda is the beneficiary of her in-laws' billion-dollar-plus estate, but she loses custody of the twins. Bound by her promise to Jack, she manages the estate with an eye to returning it to the girls. But brought up in the ghastly home environment of the Krebbs, the twins grow into hard-drinking, shoplifting, promiscuous teenagers who are taught to hate Amanda. At age 18, the girls must decide if they will accept or reject an offer from Amanda that could change the course of their lives. Blackstock's characters are fairly one-dimensional, and it's a rather far-fetched plot, but her writing is engaging. Inspirational fiction fans will likely suspend their disbelief and enjoy the story. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Romance For Dummies</h2><p>Here's a short, sweet dose of expert advice on keeping the romance in relationships.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape, save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don&#39;t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing: just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food--and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, &#34;each the other&#39;s world entire&#34;, are sustained by love.

He travelled widely in most of Asia Minor, Egypt (as far as Assuan), North Africa, Syria, the country north of the Black Sea, and many parts of the Aegean Sea and the mainland of Greece. He lived, it seems, for some time in Athens, and in 443 went with other colonists to the new city Thurii (in South Italy), where he died about 430. He was 'the prose correlative of the bard, a narrator of the deeds of real men, and a describer of foreign places' (Murray).</p><p>Herodotus's famous history of warfare between the Greeks and the Persians has an epic dignity which enhances his delightful style. It includes the rise of the Persian power and an account of the Persian empire; a description and history of Egypt; and a long digression on the geography and customs of Scythia. Even in the later books on the attacks of the Persians against Greece there are digressions. All is most entertaining and produces a grand unity.

He wasn't sure that he wanted the answers that he had come here to find. Yet with everything that he'd learned so far he couldn't simply turn his back like an old lover who'd found out he'd been betrayed.<br>His research was almost finished. He had ground his way through a million pages of old records, starting in 1917 with the Soviet Union's first secret intelligence service, the Cheka, until the breakup under Gorbachev and the dismantling of the KGB in 1991; the kidnappings and terrorism and sabotage; poisons, electric guns, honey traps, brainwashings, intimidation of countless thousands of officials and diplomats from nearly every country in the world. And assassination. The ultimate act of the state other than war. Bodies stretching back almost ninety years; piled to the rafters; more bodies than even Hitler had been credited with, making him wonder why the Soviet Union hadn't been as reviled as the Nazis were.<br>His boney, blue-veined left hand trailed along the cracked plaster wall, and he could smell the terror in the stifling air like last night's cabbage dinner; urine and shit from the overflowing communal toilets; the accumulated filth of ninety years of negelect.<br>When the KGB came it was almost always easier to commit suicide the moment the knock came on the door than to endure what would come next. But all of that was finally coming to an end. The money to operate the vast worldwide spy network was drying up.<br>Sleeper agents in place for years, some of them for thirty years or more, were being cut free from funds. Forgotten about. Their original missions no longer valid. They were the unmentionables. No one at the Kremlin wanted to know about them, let alone speak their names.<br>That meant trouble was coming. Agents cut off with no way out became desperate men. And desperate men sometimes did horrible things.<br>He stopped on the third floor landing in the rundown apartment building a few blocks north of the Bolshoi Theater and stared at the small, dirty window at the end of the hall. He waited patiently to catch his breath. His longish white hair was plastered to his neck. His research was almost done and he was afraid to think about what he had uncovered. What might be about to happen. He needed names. A way to stop the madness that he had been a part of a long time ago.<br>Last of three doors in the corridor. He'd asked at the Pivnoy Bar around the corner on Stoleshinkov pereulok for the exact address. General Gennadi Zhuralev lived alone with his books; no friends, no lovers, no trouble except his lights, which were always on until dawn. No one had thought to ask why.<br>"Tall man, was he? Broad shoulders, big ears, scar on his forehead?"<br>"No taller than average, but he always carries a canvas satchel. Heavy. Books maybe, certainly not money."<br>Dr. Nikolayev tried to dredge up a personal memory of the face from his own days as a psychologist with the KGB. But he could not. Zhuralev worked for General Baranov and the crowd in Department Viktor; assassinations, executive actions, they were called; wet affairs, <i>mokrie dela</i>, the spilling of blood; formerly the Thirteenth Department or Line F. It was Division 17 now though no one outside the SVR's First Chief Directorate was supposed to know it. He would recognize the man's face, though, from the photographs, and his voice, which had sounded gravelly on the phone.<br>He walked to the last door. The building was not quite silent; a radio or television played softly in one of the apartments, and in the other it sounded as if someone was practicing on a piano, tentatively, unsure of the notes. He hesitated out of old habit to listen for trouble sounds; the snick of a pistol slide being drawn back, sirens down on the street, boots on the stairs. The light filtering through the window was pale yellow, and his eyes were drawn to it like a moth to flame. The ceiling and walls angled inward to him, crushing his breath; he longed to escape to the clean air on the street.<br>There was someone inside the apartment who didn't belong there. He was hearing hard-soled shoes. At the Pivnoy they laughed and said that the old man always wore his bedroom slippers outside.<br>Nikolayev turned and went silently to the end of the hall, where he flattened himself in the corner next to the small window in the darker shadows. He hadn't brought a pistol.<br>The door opened, and two men came out. They were very large, their heads were shaved and they wore shiny leather jackets despite the heat. One of them carried a canvas satchel. Nikolayev's legs felt like straw. They closed the door, turned away and headed to the stairs. He watched the doorway until they were gone and he could no longer hear them on the stairs, wondering what he would have done had they turned around and seen him.<br>Zhuralev was part of the Baranov crowd. If anyone had the answers it would be him. Someone who had been there, someone who knew if the bridge still existed between then and now. He waited for a long time, thinking that he could walk away. The August heat seemed even more oppressive now.<br>He let himself into the overstuffed two-room apartment. Books and magazines and newspapers were strewn everywhere, but not as if the place had been searched. This was the way the man lived. The rooms were like a furnace, but filled with the odors of musty books, pipe tobacco and something else. Unpleasant. The hairs on the back of his neck bristled.<br>He went to the bedroom door. Gennadi Zhuralev, his blood-filled eyes open, lay on his back on the bed. He was fully clothed, carpet slippers on his feet, a silenced pistol in his slack hand. It had been made to look as if he had shot himself in the temple with the gun. But suicides did not usually go to the trouble of using a silenced pistol so that their neighbors would not be disturbed by the noise.<br>Nikolayev was conscious of his heart arrhythmia, a fluttering in his chest that made him dizzy and empty. With a feeling of deep despair he knew that he was utterly alone. He was an old man, and he valued his peace, but at what cost, he wondered, looking at Zhuralev's body. Lie down with the lions but don't expect to remain safe forever. He couldn't make his wife understand that; she loved the perks that his KGB colonel's rank brought them; food, apartment, dacha on the Istra, a car; until she bled to death on the surgeon's table. A simple gallbladder operation. But nothing was as simple as all that, not even in Moscow.<br>What was it that they hoped to cover up by killing a retired KGB officer who couldn't sleep nights and who wore carpet slippers? Nikolayev tried to feel some sorrow for the man, but he could not. Zhuralev had been a murderer.<br>What had died with him up here under the eaves? Nikolayev thought he knew the answer now, and he was frightened. Some important Americans were going to get killed if he was right and unless he did something. He could not turn away. It was far too late for that, no matter how dearly he valued his peace.<br>He got in his old BMW without windshield wipers, parked around the corner, and headed toward the Lefortovo Prison on Moscow's northeast side. They had gotten to Zhuralev, and he would be next because he had tinkered with the old files. He had to move decisively now--surprise them, give them pause long enough for him to get out. But he needed the proof first; otherwise, no one in the West would believe his fantastic story. What was in the satchel they'd carried out?<br>He was stuck, caught between a rock and a very hard place with no simple way out. He hadn't meant to uncover the operation. Hadn't meant for that to happen at all. But now it was far too late for him to turn back. Like an insect caught in the spider's web, the more he struggled, the more terrible his situation became.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2002 by David Hagberg</p><h2>Waiting on God</h2><p>How often the &#x201c;busyness&#x201d; of life can creep up and overwhelm us.

Rather than depending upon our own strength, as Christians it is our privileged birthright to enter into a daily time of reverent meditation and silence, waiting only upon God for: His answers to our problems, His direction in our lives, and, most importantly, His awesome presence refreshing our spirits and teaching us more about Himself.Andrew Murray shares thirty-one heartfelt meditations, one for each day of the month, to help renew our vision and quicken our desire to turn to the Lord for His quite, peaceful strength. Murray&#39;s own prayer was that the Lord would use these meditations &#34;to draw all to Himself, to learn in practice and experience the blessed art of waiting only upon God.&#34;<b>Andrew Murray</b> (1828&#x2013;1917) was an amazingly prolific Christian writer. He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as <i>Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, </i>and <i>With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Playboy Interviews: The Directors</h2><p>The best movies speak in a universal language, communicating effortlessly on both the emotional and the intellectual levels. While there have been many great films, only a few directors have achieved such facility with the filmmaking medium. In this collection of remarkably candid interviews, seventeen of the screen&#39;s most widely acclaimed and creative filmmakers discuss what drives and inspires them. These revealing, thought-provoking and highly personal interviews, possible only in Playboy&#39;s open forum, range from Roman Polanski&#39;s thoughts on the murder of his wife in the Manson Family massacre to Oliver Stone&#39;s frank discussions about the challenges he faced in creating his memorable films. Includes interviews with Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick, Clint Eastwood, Francis Ford Coppola, David Mamet, Spike Lee and the Coen brothers, among others.</p><p><i>Starred Review.</i> For those who read Playboy magazine "strictly for the articles," Stephen Randall and the editors of the legendary men's magazine have thoughtfully compiled sixteen of the magazine's best interviews with movie directors (sans playmates). Ranging from Orson Welles and Federico Fellini to Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers, the lengthy, unpredictable interviews prove compelling throughout. Eric Norden's conversation with Stanley Kubrick begins with a discussion of 2001: A Space Odyssey and quickly veers into the nature of God and the meaning of life. The centerpiece of Larry DuBois' 1971 conversation with Roman Polanski is a wrenching discussion of the director's experience dealing with the murder of his wife Sharon Tate and their friends by the Manson family. Elvis Mitchell's 1991 interview with Spike Lee sparkles; Mitchell engages Lee in a spirited and multifaceted discussion of the state of race relations, as well as Lee's often contentious relationship with the press and his industry peers. Since the interviews have no length restriction, interviewers are able to probe deep into their subjects and allow them to ramble expansively. While some of the material is dated, most of the interviews were conducted during particularly fertile periods for their subjects, resulting in a detailed snapshot of where these directors were at pivotal career moments.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The latest book of <i>Playboy</i> interviews (long considered the gold standard for in-depth discussion with leading cultural figures) contains 17 talks with filmmakers, from Billy Wilder in 1963 to Quentin Tarantino in 2003. Other subjects include Ingmar Bergman, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, and Orson Welles, with Clint Eastwood and Oliver Stone featured twice in interviews conducted decades apart. The discussions' seriousness belies <i>Playboy</i>'s salacious reputation; even Federico Fellini, known for the sex in his movies, avoids prurience. Serious cineastes may be disappointed that the pieces offer less on individual movies than on filmmaking in general and personality-driven anecdotes. Their digressions, however, often fascinate, from Stone on his harrowing experiences as a Vietnam grunt to Roman Polanski on his wife's grisly murder by Charles Manson's acolytes. What comes through in nearly all 17 is the strong drive of these artists in relation to their work; as Robert Altman puts it, "All I want to do is what I'm doing. What else would I do?" <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Montillo paints a rich portrait of Shelley and her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their contemporaries and their friend Lord Byron. Intellectually curious, they were artists, poets, and philosophers, united in captivation with the occultists and daring scientists risking their reputations and their immortal souls to advance our understanding of human anatomy and medicine.</p><p>These remarkable investigations could not be undertaken without the cutthroat grave robbers who prowled cemeteries for a supply of fresh corpses. The newly dead were used for both private and very public autopsies and dissections, as well as the most daring trials of all: attempts at human reanimation through the application of electricity.</p><p>Juxtaposing monstrous mechanization and rising industrialism with the sublime beauty and decadence of the legendary Romantics who defined the age, Montillo takes us into a world where poets become legends in salons and boudoirs; where fame-hungry "doctors" conduct shocking performances for rabid, wide-eyed audiences; and where maniacal body snatchers secretly toil in castle dungeons.</p></p><h2>DC Universe by Mike Mignola</h2><p><b>Adventures of DC's greatest heroes, illustrated by multi-award-winning creator Mike Mignola!</b><br><br>Mike Mignola, best known as the creator of <i>Hellboy,</i> started out his comics art career drawing the adventures of the World's Greatest Super Heroes, applying his moody artwork to tales of Superman, Batman, Swamp Thing and more.

It never occurred to me that while winging along in my happiest and most productive stage, all of a sudden simply staying afloat would require a massive exertion of will. Or of some power greater than will.<br><br> I was talking to a young boy in Northern Ireland where I was on assignment for a magazine when a bullet blew his face off. That was how fast it all changed. We were standing side by side in the sun, relaxed and triumphant after a civil rights march by the Catholics of Derry. We had been met by soldiers at the barricade; we had vomited tear gas and dragged those dented by rubber bullets back to safety. Now we were surveying the crowd from a balcony.<br><br> &#x201c;How do the paratroopers fire those gas canisters so far?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;See them jammin&#x2019; their rifle butts against the ground?&#x201d; the boy was saying when the steel slug tore into his mouth and ripped up the bridge of his nose and left of his face nothing but ground bone meal.<br><br> &#x201c;My God,&#x201d; I said dumbly, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re real bullets.&#x201d; I tried to think how to put his face back together again. Up to that moment in my life I thought everything could be mended.<br><br> Below the balcony, British armored cars began to plow into the crowd. Paratroopers jackknifed out of them with high-velocity rifles. They sprayed us with steel.<br><br> The boy without a face fell on top of me. An older man, walloped on the back of the neck with a rifle butt, stumbled up the stairs and collapsed upon us. More dazed bodies pressed in until we were like a human caterpillar, inching on our bellies up the steps of the exposed outdoor staircase.<br><br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we get into somebody&#x2019;s house!&#x201d; I shouted. We crawled up eight floors but all the doors to the flats were bolted. Someone would have to crawl out on the balcony in open fire to bang on the nearest door. Another boy howled from below: &#x201c;Jesus, I&#x2019;m hit!&#x201d; His voice propelled me across the balcony, trembling but still insulated by some soft-walled childhood sac that I thought provided for my own indestructibility. A moment later, a bullet passed a few feet in front of my nose. I hurled myself against the nearest door and we were all taken in.<br><br> The closets of the flat were already filled with mothers and their clinging children. For nearly an hour the bullets kept coming. From the window I saw three boys rise from behind a barricade to make a run for it. They were cut down like dummies in a shooting gallery. So was the priest who followed them, waving a white handkerchief, and the old man who bent to say a prayer over them. A wounded man we had dragged upstairs asked if anyone had seen his younger brother. &#x201c;Shot dead,&#x201d; was the report.<br><br> Something like this had happened to my own brother in Vietnam. But the funeral took place in the bland Connecticut country- side, and I was a few years younger. So neatly had the honor guard tricornered the victim&#x2019;s flag, it looked like a souvenir sofa pillow. People had patted my hands and said, &#x201c;We know how you must feel.&#x201d; It made me think of the strangers who were always confiding in me that they were scheduled for surgery or &#x201c;taking it easy&#x201d; after a heart attack. All I had for their pain were the same words: &#x201c;I know how you must feel.&#x201d; I had known nothing of the sort.<br><br> After the surprise massacre, I was one among trapped thousands cringing in the paper-walled bungalows of the Catholic ghetto. All exits from the city were sealed. Waiting was the only occupation. Waiting for the British army to perform a house-to-house search.<br><br> &#x201c;What will you do if the soldiers come in here firing?&#x201d; I asked the old woman who was harboring me.<br><br> &#x201c;Lie on me stomach!&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Another woman was using the telephone to confirm the names of the dead. Once upon a time I was a Protestant of strong faith; I tried to pray. But that silly game of childhood kept running through my mind . . . if you had one wish in the whole world . . . I decided to call my love. He would say the magic words to make the danger go away.<br><br> &#x201c;Hi! How are you?&#x201d; His voice was absurdly breezy; he was in bed in New York.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alive.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good, how&#x2019;s the story coming?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I almost wasn&#x2019;t alive. Thirteen people were murdered here today.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hold on. CBS News is talking about Londonderry right now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called Bloody Sunday.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you speak up?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not over. A mother of fourteen children was just run down by an armored car.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Now look, you don&#x2019;t have to get in the front lines. You&#x2019;re doing a story on Irish women, remember that. Just stick with the women and stay out of trouble. Okay, honey?&#x201d;<br><br> From the moment I hung up on that nonconversation, my head went numb. My scalp shrank. Some dark switch was thrown, and a series of weights began to roll across my brain like steel balls. I had squandered my one wish to be saved. The world was negligent. Thirteen could perish, or thirteen thousand, I could perish, and tomorrow it would all be beside the point.<br><br> As I joined the people lying on their stomachs, a powerful idea took hold: No one is with me. No one can keep me safe. There is no one who won&#x2019;t ever leave me alone.<br><br> I had a headache for a year.<br><br> When I flew home from Ireland, I couldn&#x2019;t write the story, could not confront the fact of my own mortality. In the end, I dragged out some words and made the deadline but at an ugly price. My short temper lengthened into diatribes against the people closest to me, driving away the only sources of support who might have helped me fight my demons. I broke off with the man who had been sharing my life for four years, fired my secretary, lost my housekeeper, and found myself alone with my daughter Maura, marking time.<br><br> As spring came, I hardly knew myself. The rootlessness that had been such a joy in my early thirties, allowing me to burst the ropes of old roles, to be reckless and selfish and focused on stretching my newfound dream, to roam the world on assignments and then to stay up all night typing on caffeine and nicotine&#x2014;all at once that didn&#x2019;t work anymore.<br><br> Some intruder shook me by the psyche and shouted: Take stock! Half your life has been spent. What about the part of you that wants a home and talks about a second child? Before I could answer, the intruder pointed to something else I had postponed: What about the side of you that wants to contribute to the world? Words, books, demonstrations, donations&#x2014;is this enough? You have been a performer, not a full participant. And now you are 35.<br><br> To be confronted for the first time with the arithmetic of life was, quite simply, terrifying.<br>It is unusual to find yourself in the middle of a shooting war, but many of life&#x2019;s accidents can have a similar effect. You play tennis twice a week with a dynamic 38-year-old businessman. In the locker room a silent clot throttles an artery and before he can call for help, a large part of his heart muscle has been strangled. His attack touches his wife, his business associates, and all his friends of a similar age, including you.<br><br> Or a distant phone call notifies you that your father or mother has been hospitalized. You carry with you to the bedside a picture of the dynamo you last saw, clearing land or dashing off to the League of Women Voters. In the hospital you see that this dynamo has passed, all at once and incontrovertibly, into the twilight of ill health and helplessness.<br><br> As we reach midlife in the middle thirties or early forties, we become susceptible to the idea of our own perishability. If an accident that interrupts our life occurs at this time, our fears of mortality are heightened. We are not prepared for the idea that time can run out on us, or for the startling truth that if we don&#x2019;t hurry to pursue our own definition of a meaningful existence, life can become a repetition of trivial maintenance duties. Nor are we anticipating a major upheaval of the roles and rules that may have comfortably defined us in the first half of life, but that must be reordered around a core of strongly felt personal values in the second.<br><br> In normal circumstances, without the blow of a life accident, these issues affiliated with midlife are revealed over a period of years. We have time to adjust. But when they are thrust on us all at once, we cannot immediately accept them. The downside of life comes too hard and fast to incorporate.<br><br> In my case, the unanticipated brush with death in Ireland brought the underlying issues of midlife forward in full force.<br> If i tell you about the week, six months later, if I report the observable facts&#x2014;while dashing out the door to catch a plane to Florida to cover the Democratic National Convention, a healthy, divorced career mother finds one of her pet lovebirds dead and bursts into uncontrollable tears&#x2014;you might say, &#x201c;This woman was cracking up.&#x201d; Which is precisely what I began to think.<br><br> I took the aisle seat in the tail of the plane so that when we crashed, I would be the last one to see the ground.<br><br> Flying had always been a joy to me. Plucky one that I was at 30, I had taken to parachuting out of bush planes for sport. It was different now. Whenever I went near a plane I saw a balcony in Northern Ireland. In six months the fear of airplanes had blossomed into a phobia. Every news photo of a crash drew my attention. I would study the pictures in morbid detail.

Infants' bodies are altered, and what was "ambiguous" is made "normal." Kessler's interviews with pediatric surgeons and endocrinologists reveal how the intersex condition is normalized for parents and she argues that the way in which intersexuality is managed by the medical and psychological professions displays our culture's beliefs about gender and genitals.</p><p>Parents of intersexed children are rarely heard from, but in this book they provide another perspective on reasons for genital surgeries and the quality of medical and psychological management. Although physicians educate parents about how to think about their children's condition, Kessler learned from parents of intersexed children that some parents are able to accept atypical genitals. Based on analysis of the medical literature and interview with adults who had received treatment as interesexed children, Kessler proposes new approaches for physicians to use in talking with parents and children. She also evaluates the appearance of a politicized vanguard, many of who are promoting an intersexual identity, who seek to alter the way physicians respond to intersexuality.</p><p>Kessler explores the possibilities and implications of suspending a commitment to two "natural" genders and addresses gender destabilization issues arising from intersexuality. She thus compels readers to re-think the meaning of gender, genitals, and sexuality.</p></p><p>Suzanne J.

Remember his face!&#x201d;</i><br> <br>Ben Richards is a desperate man. With no job, no money, no way out, and a young daughter in need of proper medical attention, he must turn to the only possibility of striking it rich in this near-future dystopian America: participating in the ultraviolent TV programming of the government-sanctioned Games Network. Ben soon finds himself selected as a contestant on the biggest and the best that the Games Network has to offer: The Running Man, a no-holds-barred thirty-day struggle to stay alive as public enemy number one, relentlessly hunted by an elite strike force bent on killing him as quickly as possible in front of an audience all too eager to see that happen. It means a billion dollars in prize money if he can live for the next month. No one has ever survived longer than eight days. But desperation can push a person do things they never thought possible&#x2014;and Ben Richards is willing to go the distance in this ultimate game of life and death....<br> <br>&#x201c;Under any name King mesmerizes the reader.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br> &#x201c;No one does psychological terror better!&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> &#x201c;One of America&#x2019;s top storytellers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i></p><p>Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) crafted <i>The Running Man</i> early in his career, though after such mega-hits as <i>Carrie</i> and <i>The Shining</i>. A bit of a departure from the supernatural horror that is most frequently associated with his work, the novel describes a science fiction dystopia where market capitalism and television game shows have spiraled out of control, and the separation between the haves and the have-nots has been formalized with separate currencies. King establishes characters quickly, creating sympathy in the first few pages for Ben Richards--whose 18-month-old baby girl is suffering from a horrible cough, perhaps pneumonia. Not able to afford medicine, Richards enters himself in the last-chance money-making scheme of the Free-Vee games. The games include <i>Treadmill to Bucks</i>, in which heart-attack prone contestants struggle to outlast a progressively demanding treadmill, or the accurately named <i>Swim the Crocodiles</i>. After a rigorous battery of physical and mental examinations, Richards is assigned "Elevator Six"--the path of a chosen few--that leads to <i>The Running Man</i> game. In this game, the stakes and the prizes are raised. Success means a life of luxury. Failure means death. Unfortunately, few ever win the game; in fact, as the producer tells Richards, in six years no one has survived.<p> <i>The Running Man</i> is a short book, tightly written to be read and enjoyed quickly. The future world it depicts is vividly captured with a few essential details. The action is also fast paced and, though the novel differs from much of King's other work, the sardonic social commentary reveals a pleasing glimmer of King's characteristically twisted sense of humor. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation,</i> <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King) and the Bill Hodges trilogy, <i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

In <i>The Meadowlands</i>, Sullivan does his Thoreauvian bean-counting in one of America's most infamous dumping grounds, the huge tract of marshy land just outside New York City that has withstood any and all attempts to subdue it with agriculture, industry, development, and an ever-shifting deluge of flotsam and jetsam. He may just be the first person in a century to willingly explore this fascinating but abused piece of real estate, and his investigation gives new meaning to intrepid reporting. By foot he tramps through the muck, and by canoe he navigates polluted rivers and marshes, noting the variegated species of trash and industrial cast-offs with as much zeal as he observes the surprisingly rich diversity of wildlife. Revealed in these stories is a landscape bursting with nature amid the curious man-made detritus of urban consumption. With only a touch of irony, the author refers to his stomping ground as "Big Sky Country, east," imagining he's "in a <i>National Geographic</i> special and visiting little tribes of people unknown to everyone else." He pursues the history of the Meadowlands with equal enthusiasm. Eccentric characters, tall tales, and scuttlebutt haunt the area, from the rumor that the land serves as the final resting place for Jimmy Hoffa (as well as a number of other Mafia hits) to the pitiable stories of the many dreamers who have sunk a fortune in the squelching mud. And throughout this smart, thoroughly researched adventure, Sullivan maintains a witty and lyrical voice that transforms his trip inside a nationally maligned place into a fun, informative romp.Imagine a grunge nort Jersey version of John McPhee&#39;s classic The Pine Barrens and you&#39;ll get some idea of the idiosyncratic, fact-filled, and highly original work that is Robert Sullivan&#39;s The Meadowlands. Just five miles west of New York City, this vilified, half-developed, half-untamed, much dumped-on, and sometimes odiferous tract of swampland is home to rare birds and missing bodies, tranquil marshes and a major sports arena, burning garbage dumps and corporate headquarters, the remains of the original Penn Station--and maybe, just, maybe, of the late Jimmy Hoffa. Robert Sullivan proves himself to be this fragile yet amazingly resilient region&#39;s perfect expolorer, historian, archaeologist, and comic bard.</p><h2>Survival in Auschwitz and The Reawakening, Two Memoirs</h2><p>The author describes his twenty month ordeal in the Nazi death camp</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)"No human experience is without meaning or unworthy of analysis," writes Levinot even the "gigantic biological and social experiment that was Auschwitz." And few accounts of concentration camps are as remarkable and truthful as these twin memoirs, reissued here after being long out of print in hardcover. Levi (The Periodic Table; If Not Now, When?) wrote Survival in Auschwitz soon after his return to Turin in 1945. Although he strikingly depicts the filth, hunger, sleeplessness and anxiety there, he focuses on the human beings who were his captors and companionsthe good and bad, the "drowned and the saved." Writing as witness rather than judge, he sets down only the facts of which he had direct experience. In 1962, Levi wrote The Reawakening, about his return odyssey to Turin, and again recalls his experiences mainly in terms of the people he met.

Nevertheless, he maintains that, but for Washington, the office of president might not exist today. McDonald asserts that Washington's reputation as a man of integrity, dignity, candor, and republican virtue was well-deserved, and that he contributed best by serving as a symbol.<br><br>The book covers the central concerns of Washington's administration: a complex tangle of war debts; the organization of the Bank of the United States; geographical and social factionalism; the emergence of strong national partisan politics; adjustments in federal-state relations; the effort to remain neutral in the face of European tumult; the opening of the Mississippi River; and the removal of the threat of Indians and British in the Northwest Territory.

How that doctrine went from being a minority opinion at the beginning of the nineteenth century to a solemnly defined dogma at the First Vatican Council in 1870 makes for the fascinating story of personality conflicts, papal politics, and doctrinal transformations that the Swiss historian August Berhard Hasler recounts in this controversial book. At center stage is the redoubtable Pius IX, for whom the achievement of a binding conciliar definition of papal infallibility became a crusade, if not an obsession. Hasler details how he bullied and coerced opponents of the definition and hounded doubters after the doctrine was proclaimed by having their works placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, Did the pope&#39;s epilepsy influence his behavior? Did the pressures ha and his allies exerted on the waverers among the bishops render the Council unfree and its decisions of questionable validity? These are the kinds of questions Father Hasler raises in his thought-provoking and ultimately constructive effort to reopen debate on the major issue that still divides Christians and makes headlines more than a century after the doctrine was solemnly proclaimed.</p><p>Text: English, German</p><h2>Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul</h2><p>Spiritual attainment has frequently been described as a transformation whereby a human's leaden, dull nature is returned to its golden state.

But, throughout his career, Robert Maxwell also nurtured another, more driving, and&#x2014;until now&#x2014;altogether hidden ambition, and that was to spy for Israel&#x2019;s Mossad. In the end, as Gordon Thomas, an author who has long been trolling the murky waters of international intelligence, shows in this gripping narrative, the conflict between the tycoon&#x2019;s public interests and spy&#x2019;s secret pursuits led to his mystifying death, officially by drowning, in November 1991, offshore of the Canary Islands. According to Thomas&#x2019;s well-placed sources in Israel, Washington, and London, Maxwell first came into Mossad&#x2019;s orbit in the 1970s, when the crack Israeli spy organization stole from the United States its most sophisticated piece of intelligence-gathering software, Enhanced Promis. Of it Mossad made an electronic Trojan horse, secretly amassing strictly classified information from inside the very organizations worldwide to which they were selling it. Mossad&#x2019;s representative for these extremely sensitive transactions costing tens of millions of dollars in China, Russia, India, and twenty other countries was Robert Maxwell. Only Maxwell was also helping himself to some of Mossad&#x2019;s profits&#x2014;as well as $750 million from his employees&#x2019; pension fund&#x2014;in desperate attempts to maintain his empire and to meet the demands of increasingly intolerant creditors. Aboard his yacht that November night in 1991 Maxwell no doubt still clung to the hope of a bailout by Mossad. But Mossad&#x2019;s spy masters could not afford to smile on blackmail. This book reveals all the shocking reasons why. Eight pages of black-and-white photographs add to this astonishing tale of international intrigue, espionage, the Mossad, and murder.</p><p>In 1991, British media tycoon Robert Maxwell died in mysterious circumstances off his yacht in the Canary Islands. The official cause of death was drowning, but this intriguing, if somewhat overreaching, investigative work argues that Maxwell died at the hands of the spy agency he worked for, Israel's Mossad. Thomas (Gideon's Spies) and Dillon (Shankill Butchers) have little sympathy for Maxwell-they build an unflattering portrait of an overweight and vain man who rose from a pre-WWII Jewish childhood in Czechoslovakia and England to become one of the world's most powerful media barons. Using a wealth of international sources-Israeli and British intelligence, for instance, both named and anonymous-the authors argue that Maxwell helped the Mossad steal intelligence-gathering software from the U.S. and then sold it around the world. They also depict Maxwell's involvement in several other international intrigues, including an attempt to involve the Jewish state in the 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev. Much of the book has a breathless tone, particularly when the authors describe, in detail, the night of Maxwell's death. The Mossad "whacked" Maxwell, they say, because he tried to extort money from them to get out of debt. Some readers might find the depiction of the Mossad at times hard to believe, such as the suggestion that the spy agency was entangled in the death of Sen. John Tower. But those interested in the world of international intrigue will find themselves engrossed. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Here's the latest revision of history by the wide-ranging and conspiracy-minded Thomas. This time Thomas and coauthor Dillon contend that Robert Maxwell, the media giant, did not drown in 1991 but was murdered by his former employer, the Israeli Mossad, after he tried to extort money from it. That Maxwell was a Mossad spy is not a new idea: Thomas himself floated it in <i>Gideon's Spies</i>, his 1999 history of Mossad, and Victor Ostrovsky, a former Mossad agent, proposed it in his own memoir, <i>The Other Side of Deception</i> (1995). Thomas and Dillon interviewed Ostrovsky for their book; they also interviewed Efraim, a former Mossad assassin who claims to have been involved in the Maxwell murder; Maxwell's widow and daughter; two former CIA directors; three former prime ministers of Israel; the former director-general of Mossad; and a host of related experts. They don't prove their case beyond a shadow of doubt, but they do present a reasoned and well-supported argument. Whether it's the startling truth or merely revisionist nonsense, it makes a thought-provoking and compelling book. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Wisely beginning with Versailles, he uses a topical approach to illuminate his vast canvas. There is more storytelling than serious analysis here, but the wartime drama is related with deftness and enticing detail. His portrayal of personalities is excellent.

You see, the first few times I baked it, I found the texture a little too dry. I revamped the recipe adding more brown sugar and replacing butter with oil. It turned out to be one of the best pound cake decisions in the world! The result is one intensely rich cake with a tight, dense crumb.

Spray a 9 x 5 inch (23 x 13 cm) loaf pan with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until combined. Whisk in the milk, oil, vanilla, and vanilla seeds. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix. Remove 1 cup of the batter and pour into a small bowl. Stir in the cocoa powder. Pour one-third of the vanilla batter into the prepared loaf pan. Spoon 1&#x2215;3 of the chocolate batter on top. Repeat until both batters are gone. Gently swirl a large knife through the batter, making rounded horizontal zig-zags from one side of the pan to the other. Wipe the excess batter from the knife. Repeat the swirling pattern in the opposite direction. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the cake with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The loaf is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out practically clean with only a few moist crumbs. Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack before removing and slicing.

Don&#x2019;t panic. I&#x2019;m in charge. I, Rebecca Brandon (n�e Bloomwood), am the adult. Not my two-year-old daughter.<br>Only I&#x2019;m not sure she realizes this.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, darling, give me the pony.&#x201d; I try to sound calm and assured, like Nanny Sue off the telly.<br>&#x201c;Poneeee.&#x201d; Minnie grips the toy pony more tightly.<br>&#x201c;No pony.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mine!&#x201d; she cries hysterically. &#x201c;Miiiine poneee!&#x201d;<br>Argh. I&#x2019;m holding about a million shopping bags, my face is sweating, and I could really do without this.<br>It was all going so well. I&#x2019;d been round the whole shopping mall and bought all the last little things on my Christmas list. Minnie and I were heading toward Santa&#x2019;s Grotto, and I only stopped for a moment to look at a dollhouse. Whereupon Minnie grabbed a toy pony off the display and refused to put it back. And now I&#x2019;m in the middle of Ponygate.<br>A mother in J Brand skinny jeans with an impeccably dressed daughter walks past, giving me the Mummy Once-Over, and I flinch. Since I had Minnie, I&#x2019;ve learned that the Mummy Once-Over is even more savage than the Manhattan Once-Over. In the Mummy Once-Over, they don&#x2019;t just assess and price your clothes to the nearest penny in one sweeping glance. Oh no. They also take in your child&#x2019;s clothes, pram brand, nappy bag, snack choice, and whether your child is smiling, snotty, or screaming.<br>Which I know is a lot to take in, in a one-second glance, but believe me, mothers are multitaskers.<br>Minnie definitely scores top marks for her outfit. (Dress: one-off Danny Kovitz; coat: Rachel Riley; shoes: Baby Dior.) And I&#x2019;ve got her safely strapped into her toddler reins (Bill Amberg leather, really cool; they were in Vogue). But instead of smiling angelically like the little girl in the photo shoot, she&#x2019;s straining against them like a bull waiting to dash into the ring. Her eyebrows are knitted with fury, her cheeks are bright pink, and she&#x2019;s drawing breath to shriek again.<br>&#x201c;Minnie.&#x201d; I let go of the reins and put my arms round her so that she feels safe and secure, just like it recommends in Nanny Sue&#x2019;s book, Taming Your Tricky Toddler. I bought it the other day, to have a flick through. Just out of idle interest. I mean, it&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m having problems with Minnie or anything. It&#x2019;s not that she&#x2019;s difficult. Or &#x201c;out of control and willful,&#x201d; like that stupid teacher at the toddler music group said. (What does she know? She can&#x2019;t even play the triangle properly.)<br><p>The thing about Minnie is, she&#x2019;s . . . spirited. She has firm opinions about things. Like jeans (she won&#x2019;t wear them) or carrots (she won&#x2019;t eat them). And right now her firm opinion is that she should have a toy pony.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, darling, I love you very much,&#x201d; I say in a gentle, crooning voice, &#x201c;and it would make me very happy if you gave me the pony. That&#x2019;s right, give it to Mummy.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve nearly done it. My fingers are closing around the pony&#x2019;s head . . .<br>Ha. Skills. I&#x2019;ve got it. I can&#x2019;t help looking round to see if anyone&#x2019;s observed my expert parenting.<br>&#x201c;Miiiine!&#x201d; Minnie wrenches the pony out of my hand and makes a run for it across the shop floor. Shit.<br>&#x201c;Minnie! Minnie!&#x201d; I yell.<br>I grab my carrier bags and leg it furiously after Minnie, who has already disappeared into the Action Man section. God, I don&#x2019;t know why we bother training all these athletes for the Olympics. We should just field a team of toddlers.<br>As I catch up with her, I&#x2019;m panting. I really have to start my postnatal exercises sometime.<br>&#x201c;Give me the pony!&#x201d; I try to take it, but she&#x2019;s gripping it like a limpet.<br>&#x201c;Mine poneee!&#x201d; Her dark eyes flash at me with a resolute glint. Sometimes I look at Minnie and she&#x2019;s so like her father it gives me a jolt.<br>Speaking of which, where is Luke? We were supposed to be doing Christmas shopping together. As a family. But he disappeared an hour ago, muttering something about a call he had to make, and I haven&#x2019;t seen him since. He&#x2019;s probably sitting somewhere having a civilized cappuccino over the newspaper. Typical.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, we&#x2019;re not buying it,&#x201d; I say in my best firm manner. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got lots of toys already and you don&#x2019;t need a pony.&#x201d;<br>A woman with straggly dark hair, gray eyes, and toddlers in a twin buggy shoots me an approving nod. I can&#x2019;t help giving her the Mummy Once-Over myself, and she&#x2019;s one of those mothers who wears Crocs over nubbly homemade socks. (Why would you do that? Why?)<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s monstrous, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Those ponies are forty pounds! My kids know better than to even ask,&#x201d; she adds, shooting a glance at her two boys, who are slumped silently, thumbs in mouths. &#x201c;Once you give in to them, that&#x2019;s the beginning of the end. I&#x2019;ve got mine well trained.&#x201d;<br>Show-off.<br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; I say in dignified tones. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Some parents would just buy their kid that pony for a quiet life. No discipline. It&#x2019;s disgusting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Terrible,&#x201d; I agree, and make a surreptitious swipe for the pony, which Minnie adeptly dodges. Damn.<br>&#x201c;The biggest mistake is giving in to them.&#x201d; The woman is regarding Minnie with a pebblelike gaze. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what starts the rot.&#x201d;<br>Well, I never give in to my daughter,&#x201d; I say briskly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not getting the pony, Minnie, and that&#x2019;s final.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poneeee!&#x201d; Minnie&#x2019;s wails turn to heartrending sobs. She is such a drama queen. (She gets it from my mum.)<br>&#x201c;Good luck, then.&#x201d; The woman moves off. &#x201c;Happy Christmas.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Minnie, stop!&#x201d; I hiss furiously as soon as she&#x2019;s disappeared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re embarrassing both of us! What do you want a stupid pony for, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poneeee!&#x201d; She&#x2019;s cuddling the pony to her as though it&#x2019;s her long-lost faithful pet that was sold at market five hundred miles away and has just stumbled back to the farm, footsore and whickering for her.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a silly toy,&#x201d; I say impatiently. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so special about it, anyway?&#x201d; And for the first time I look properly at the pony.<br>Wow. Actually . . . it is pretty fab. It&#x2019;s made of painted white wood with glittery stars all over and the sweetest hand-painted face. And it has little red trundly wheels.<br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t need a pony, Minnie,&#x201d; I say&#x2014;but with slightly less conviction than before. I&#x2019;ve just noticed the saddle. Is that genuine leather? And it has a proper bridle with buckles and the mane is made of real horsehair. And it comes with a grooming set!<br>For forty quid this isn&#x2019;t bad value at all. I push one of the little red wheels, and it spins round perfectly. Now that I think about it, Minnie doesn&#x2019;t have a toy pony. It&#x2019;s quite an obvious gap in her toy cupboard.<br>I mean, not that I&#x2019;m going to give in.<br>&#x201c;It winds up too,&#x201d; comes a voice behind me, and I turn to see an elderly sales assistant approaching us. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a key in the base. Look!&#x201d;<br>She winds the key, and both Minnie and I watch, mesmerized, as the pony starts rising and falling in a carousel motion while tinkly music plays.<br>Oh my God, I love this pony.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on special Christmas offer at forty pounds,&#x201d; the assistant adds. &#x201c;Normally this would retail for seventy. They&#x2019;re handmade in Sweden.&#x201d;<br>Nearly fifty percent off. I knew it was good value. Didn&#x2019;t I say it was good value?<br>&#x201c;You like it, don&#x2019;t you, dear?&#x201d; The assistant smiles at Minnie, who beams back, her stroppiness vanished. In fact, I don&#x2019;t want to boast, but she looks pretty adorable with her red coat and dark pigtails and dimpled cheeks. &#x201c;So, would you like to buy one?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I . . . um . . .&#x201d; I clear my throat.<br>Come on, Becky. Say no. Be a good parent. Walk away.<br>My hand steals out and strokes the mane again.<br>But it&#x2019;s so gorgeous. Look at its dear little face. And a pony isn&#x2019;t like some stupid craze, is it? You&#x2019;d never get tired of a pony. It&#x2019;s a classic. It&#x2019;s, like, the Chanel jacket of toys.<br>And it&#x2019;s Christmas. And it&#x2019;s on special offer. And, who knows, Minnie might turn out to have a gift for riding, it suddenly occurs to me. A toy pony might be just the spur she needs. I have a sudden vision of her at age twenty, wearing a red jacket, standing by a gorgeous horse at the Olympics, saying to the TV cameras, &#x201c;It all began one Christmas, when I received the gift that changed my life. . . .&#x201d;<br>My mind is going round and round like a computer processing DNA results, trying to find a match. There has to be a way in which I can simultaneously: 1) Not give in to Minnie&#x2019;s tan?trum; 2) be a good parent; and 3) buy the pony. I need some clever blue-sky solution like Luke is always paying business consultants scads of money to come up with . . .<br>And then the answer comes to me. A totally genius idea which I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve never had before. I haul out my phone and text Luke:<br>Luke! Have just had a really good thought. I think Minnie should get pocket money.<br>Immediately a reply pings back:<br>Wtf? Why?<br>So she can buy things, of course! I start to type. Then I think again. I delete the text and carefully type instead:<br>Children need to learn about finance from early age. Read it in article. Empowers them and gives responsibility.<br>A moment later Luke texts: Can&#x2019;t we just buy her the FT?<br>Shut up. I type: We&#x2019;ll say two pounds a week shall we?<br>R u mad? Comes zipping back: 10p a week is plenty.<br>I stare at the phone indignantly. 10p?

Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. 'TAKE IT EASY, MR BOND'</b></p> <p>It was one of those days when it seemed to James Bond that all life, as someone put it, was nothing but a heap of six to four against.</p> <p>To begin with he was ashamed of himself - a rare state of mind. He had a hangover, a bad one, with an aching head and stiff joints. When he coughed -smoking too much goes with drinking too much and doubles the hangover - a cloud of small luminous black spots swam across his vision like amoebae in pond water. The one drink too many signals itself unmistakably. His final whisky and soda in the luxurious flat in Park Lane had been no different from the ten preceding ones, but it had gone down reluctantly and had left a bitter taste and an ugly sensation of surfeit. And, although he had taken in the message, he had agreed to play just one more rubber. Five pounds a hundred as it's the last one? He had agreed. And he had played the rubber like a fool. Even now he could see the queen of spades, with that stupid Mona Lisa smile on her fat face, slapping triumphantly down on his knave - the queen, as his partner had so sharply reminded him, that had been so infallibly marked with South, and that had made the difference between a grand slam redoubled (drunkenly) for him, and four hundred points above the line for the opposition. In the end it had been a twenty-point rubber, �100 against him - important money. &#x2014; Again Bond dabbed with the bloodstained styptic pencil at the cut on his chin and despised the face that stared sullenly back at him from the mirror above the washbasin. Stupid, ignorant bastard! It all came from having nothing to do. More than a month of paper-work - ticking off his number on stupid dockets, scribbling minutes that got spikier as the weeks passed, and snap-ping back down the telephone when some harmless section officer tried to argue with him. And then his secretary had gone down with the flu and he had been given a silly, and, worse, ugly bitch from the pool who called him 'sir' and spoke to him primly through a mouth full of fruit stones. And now it was another Monday morning. Another week was beginning. The May rain thrashed at the windows. Bond swallowed down two Phensics and reached for the Enos. The telephone in his bedroom rang. It was the loud ring of the direct line with Headquarters.</p> <p>James Bond, his heart thumping faster than it should have done, despite the race across London and a fretful wait for the lift to the eighth floor, pulled out the chair and sat down and looked across into the calm, grey, damnably clear eyes he knew so well. What could he read in them?</p> <p>'Good morning, James. Sorry to pull you along a bit early in the morning. Got a very full day ahead. Wanted to fit you in before the rush.'</p> <p>Bond's excitement waned minutely. It was never a good sign when M addressed him by his Christian name instead of by his number. This didn't look like a job - more like something personal. There was none of the tension in M's voice that heralded big, exciting news. M's expression was interested, friendly, almost benign. Bond said something noncommittal.</p> <p>'Haven't seen much of you lately, James. How have you been? Your health, I mean.' M picked up a sheet of paper, a form of some kind, from his desk, and held it as if preparing to read.</p> <p>Suspiciously, trying to guess what the paper said, what all this was about, Bond said, 'I'm all right, sir.'</p> <p>M said mildly, 'That's not what the MO thinks, James. Just had your last Medical. I think you ought to hear what he has to say.'</p> <p>Bond looked angrily at the back of the paper. Now what the hell! He said with control, 'Just as you say, sir.'</p> <p>M gave Bond a careful, appraising glance. He held the paper closer to his eyes. '"This officer",' he read, '"remains basically physically sound. Unfortunately his mode of life is not such as is likely to allow him to remain in this happy state. Despite many previous warnings, he admits to smoking sixty cigarettes a day. These are of a Balkan mixture with a higher nicotine content than the cheaper varieties. When not engaged upon strenuous duty, the officer's average daily consumption of alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between sixty and seventy proof. On examination, there continues to be little definite sign of deterioration. The tongue is furred. The blood pressure a little raised at 160/90. The liver is not palpable. On the other hand, when pressed, the officer admits to frequent occipital headaches and there is spasm in the trapezius muscles and so-called 'fibrositis' nodules can be felt. I believe these symptoms to be due to this officer's mode of life. He is not responsive to the suggestion that over-indulgence is no remedy for the tensions inherent in his professional calling and can only result in the creation of a toxic state which could finally have the effect of reducing his fitness as an officer. I recommend that No 007 should take it easy for two to three weeks on a more abstemious regime, when I believe he would make a complete return to his previous exceptionally high state of physical fitness.'"</p> <p>M reached over and slid the report into his OUT tray. He put his hands flat down on the desk in front of him and looked sternly across at Bond. He said, 'Not very satisfactory is it, James?'</p> <p>Bond tried to keep impatience out of his voice. He said, 'I'm perfectly fit, sir. Everyone has occasional headaches. Most weekend golfers have fibrositis. You get it from sweating and then sitting in a draught. Aspirin and embrocation get rid of them. Nothing to it really, sir.'</p> <p>M said severely, 'That's just where you're making a big mistake, James. Taking medicine only suppresses these symptoms of yours. Medicine doesn't get to the root of the trouble. It only conceals it. The result is a more highly poisoned condition, which may become chronic disease. All drugs are harmful to the system. They are contrary to nature. The same applies to most of the food we eat - white bread with all the roughage removed, refined sugar with all the goodness machined out of it, pasteurised milk which has had most of the vitamins boiled away, everything overcooked and denaturized. Why,' M reached into his pocket for his notebook and consulted it, 'do you know what our bread contains apart from a bit of over-ground flour?' M looked accusingly at Bond, 'It contains large quantities of chalk, also benzol peroxide powder, chlorine gas, sal ammoniac, and alum.' M put the notebook back in his pocket. 'What do you think of that?'</p> <p>Bond, mystified by all this, said defensively, 'I don't eat all that much bread, sir.'</p> <p>'Maybe not,' said M impatiently. 'But how much stone-ground whole wheat do you eat? How much yoghurt? Uncooked vegetables, nuts, fresh fruit?'</p> <p>Bond smiled. 'Practically none at all, sir.'</p> <p>'It's no laughing matter.' M tapped his forefinger on the desk for emphasis. 'Mark my words. There is no way to health except the natural way. All your troubles' - Bond opened his mouth to protest, but M held up his hand - 'the deep-seated toxaemia revealed by your Medical, are the result of a basically unnatural way of life. Ever heard of Bircher-Brenner, for instance? Or Kneipp, Preissnitz, Rikli, Schroth, Gossmann, Bilz?'</p> <p>'No, sir.'</p> <p>'Just so. Well those are the men you would be wise to study. Those are the great naturopaths - the men whose teaching we have foolishly ignored. Fortunately,' M's eyes gleamed enthusiastically, 'there are a number of disciples of these men practising in England. Nature cure is not beyond our reach.'</p> <p>James Bond looked curiously at M. What the hell had got into the old man? Was all this the first sign of senile decay? But M looked fitter than Bond had ever seen him. The cold grey eyes were clear as crystal and the skin of the hard, lined face was luminous with health. Even the iron-grey hair seemed to have new life. Then what was all this lunacy?</p> <p>M reached for his IN tray and placed it in front of him in a preliminary gesture of dismissal. He said cheerfully, 'Well, that's all, James. Miss Moneypenny has made the reservation. Two weeks will be quite enough to put you right. You won't know yourself when you come out. New man.'</p> <p>Bond looked across at M, aghast.

He'll take good care of you. Very up-to-date equipment, and he's even got his own herb garden. Nice stretch of country. Near Washington in Sussex. And don't worry about your work here.

I can't afford to have an officer in that section who isn't one hundred per cent fit.' M lowered his eyes to the basket in front of him and took out a signal file. 'That's all, 007.' He didn't look up. The tone of voice was final.</p> <p>Bond got to his feet. He said nothing. He walked across the room and let himself out, closing the door with exaggerated softness.</p> <p>Outside the door, Miss Moneypenny looked sweetly up at him.</p> <p>Bond walked over to her desk and banged his fist down so that the typewriter jumped.

Also included are the passages in the New Testament Gospels that feature Mary Magdalene, and they can now be read in a whole new light. Cumulatively, these texts reveal a vibrant oral tradition in which Mary Magdalene is not only a follower of Jesus but his companion and closest disciple.</p><p> The book will include lively historical introduction by Meyer, and an interpretive essay by Karen King at Harvard Divinity School, the foremost expert on the Gospel of Mary, whose translation and commentary on the Gospel of Mary is being published by an academic press in October '03.</p><p> </p></p><p>One of the foremost scholars on Gnosticism now explores the fascinating and often misinterpreted woman known as Mary Magdalene. Following the recent whirl of interest in Mary Magdalene that was generated by <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, Marvin Meyer (<i>The Ancient Mysteries</i>) delves into the earliest texts available to reveal a disciple of great spiritual maturity who was extremely influential in the survival of Christianity. Although he is doubtful of the grand conspiracies laid out in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, Meyers does believe that it was institutionalized sexism that caused Mary to be deliberately "marginalized" as a prostitute in the New Testament. "The portrait of Mary in literature and art as a reformed whore is impressive, but it is mistaken in terms of historical accuracy and literary interpretation," he asserts. "...It was not until the late sixth century that Po! pe Gregory the Great formally identified Mary Magdalene with the prostitute of Luke 7, and the identification stuck." In fact, Meyer claims that there is no convincing documentation to link Mary with the unnamed prostitute who washes Jesus' feet with her tears. Using his scholarly authority as well as extensive research supplied by Esther A. De Boer, Ph.D. (<i>Mary Magdalene: Beyond the Myth</i>), he helps Mary emerge from the shadows of Orthodox Church and gain her rightful place as the highly influential disciple and apostle of Jesus. He believes that Mary had a physical love relationship with Jesus, and was probably the mysterious "beloved" disciple that is mentioned in the Gospel of John. Furthermore, he believes that Jesus may have seen Mary as the most spiritually evolved disciple. Much of the book includes quotes and interpretations of the earliest literary sources available, including the recently discovered Gospel of Mary (written in the second century), as well as the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, Peter, Thomas, and Phillip. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Marvin Meyer is one of the <em>foremost</em> scholars on early Christianity and texts about Jesus outside the New Testament. He is Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California.

Kim goes to the cutting edge, looking at the latest, most experimental techniques and materials for textile design and practice. Through exercises and inspirational examples from emerging artists, she takes you through the entire process, from finding an original idea to transforming the designs into finished textiles. Paper, felt, recycling, hand stitching, working in 3-D, layering different media, and more make this essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Kim Thittichai is a popular textile artist who specialises in teaching experimental textiles. Her speciality is creating three-dimensional textile forms. She does workshops and lecture nationally and exhibits her work at various textiles shows across the UK. She is the author of the best selling Hot Textiles. She lives in Brighton.If you struggle with getting ideas out of your head onto paper and into finished art project, I believe this book will help you. It shows you basic processes that are easy to follow, to get ideas onto paper and then to take those ideas onwards to produce a piece of finished work. There are plenty of ideas for developing work. A number of artists are showcased in this book, all exploring textiles in their own way. There is a small section on the rudimentary basics of colour. Part two gives some ideas and inspiration for choosing a subject with which to work. As there are no projects to follow, I found this section a little unfulfilling. However, I still think it is worth getting hold of this book as it might well trigger your own thought processes and show you how to get started. 128pages of colour, with great production form the Batsford team. http://www.karenplatt.co.uk</p><h2>That&#39;s Not Fair!: Getting to Know Your Rights and Freedoms (CitizenKid)</h2><p>This unique addition to the CitizenKid collection, written by by Danielle S. McLaughlin, provides an accessible exploration of the rights and freedoms of citizens in a democracy through a series of six short stories starring Mayor Moe and the councillors of a sometimes wacky city. In each story, the councillors are first presented with a problem, and the group then makes a decision to address the problem with a new law, only to discover later there were unintended consequences. There is one councillor, Bug, who objects to each decision being proposed by commenting, ?That&#39;s not fair!? --- a sentiment familiar to children, who have an innate sense of justice. The topics are child-friendly: Should you be allowed to search someone&#39;s bag because you think they could have something of yours? Does it make sense to have a law that states people can say only nice things? Conclusions for each story include an extended discussion of the rights and freedoms featured in the story, along with three questions to ponder: Why did the councillors make their decision? Did the new law achieve its purpose? Were there any unexpected results? There are no right answers given. Instead children are encouraged to look at all sides of each issue, which engages their critical thinking skills and fosters empathy for other points of view. This book would be perfect for sparking spirited discussions on civics lessons and inspiring children to become involved citizens. The bright and humorous illustrations by Dharmali Patel keep the interest level high. A Note for Parents and Teachers and definitions of the rights and freedoms covered in each story are included at the end of the book.</p><p><p>Dharmali was born in Mumbai, India. As a kid, she was fascinated with the world of animation. In 2000, she obtained a diploma in Applied Arts with a major in illustration. She is constantly exploring new illustration styles and loves the process of creating illustrations for children's books.</p>Gr 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;Adapted from a video series by the Canadian Civil Liberties Education Trust, this title takes children through a series of episodes about unfair laws in order to teach them about democracy and rights. In an unnamed city, the bumbling Mayor Moe and his councillors, a multicolored group of anthropomorphized creatures, make unfair laws, each of which brings unforeseen consequences. Topics range from freedom of assembly to employment discrimination. The sole voice of reason is Councillor Bug, who consistently squeaks, "That's not fair!" At the end of each section, there is a summary and questions to get readers thinking. While this selection is very Western-centric, there is no mention of the Bill of Rights, which to an audience in the United States may be confusing and limit understanding of how these legal rights are guaranteed. Mayor Moe is also referred to as "Your Worship," another specifically Canadian reference. With no index or bibliography, the book reads more like a discussion starter than an informational text. The digitally rendered characters are cartoony and exaggerated, but the complicated language, with no glossary or definitions, makes it difficult to determine the appropriate audience. VERDICT Purchase as a supplement and discussion aide for curricula about rights and freedoms, but pair with another volume with more specific material about the Bill of Rights.&#x2014;Clara Hendricks, Cambridge Public Library, MA</p><h2>Making Paths &amp; Walkways: Creative Ideas and Simple Techniques</h2><p>Full-color photographs and detailed instructions explain how to create a wide variety of walkways and paths to suit an array of landscapes and sites from such materials as stone, brick, concrete, gravel, pine needles, straw, bark, and more.</p><p>Paige Gilchrist Blomgren takes an almost spiritual approach to this new book. "We long to head out," she says in the introduction, "to explore new territory, change our surroundings, and find a better--or just different--view. We daydream about setting out for parts unknown as we contemplate paths to wisdom, spiritual paths, and--in the wee hours--the notion of the one true path."<p> Regardless of your destination, choosing your path is a significant and defining part of the journey. It is much the same in your garden, yard, or entryway at home, where paths and walkways create a feeling, a presence, an amusing diversion, a hint of things to come, or simply a warm welcome.</p><p> This is a comprehensive manual that covers all the basics: siting; design and positioning of a path; discussions of all manner of materials that can be used; and basic how-to advice for planning, grading, clearing, marking, leveling, digging, and providing for proper drainage.</p><p> At the same time, Blomgren's sense of history and many-layered view of gardening and life make this an unusually deep and enjoyable look at more than the basic nuts and bolts of creating walks and pathways. The book is generously illustrated with helpful drawings and beautiful color photographs of gorgeous walks and paths, and lively descriptions and photographs from famous walkways and paths in history are sprinkled throughout the book. Blomgren has made "choosing your path in life" clear and attainable in this lovely and lively book. <i>--Mark A.

He heard something. </p> <p> The first rays of the sun flamed over the ridge to the east, knifing through the pine boughs and morning haze in translucent wedges, backlighting tiny galaxies of swirling bugs. Soon the warming air would float up the draw and the pines would whisper like distant surf, but in the lull between the cool of night and the warmth of day, the air was still, the sounds distinct. The Hunter heard his own pulse. The scraping of branches against his camouflage sleeves was crisp and brilliant, the snapping of twigs under his boots almost startling. </p> <p> And the eerie howl was clear enough to reach him from miles away, audible under the sound of the jays and between the chatterings of a squirrel. </p> <p> He waited, not breathing, until he heard it again: long, mournful, rising in pitch, and then holding that anguished note to the point of agony before trailing off. </p> <p> The Hunter's brow crinkled under the bill of his cap. The howl was too deep and guttural for a wolf. A cougar never made a sound like that. A bear? Not to his knowledge. If it was his quarry, it was upset about something. </p> <p> And far ahead of him. </p> <p> He moved again, quickstepping, ducking branches, eyes darting about, dealing with the distance. </p> <p> Before he had worked his way through the forest another mile, he saw a breach in the forest canopy and an open patch of daylight through the trees. He was coming to a clearing. </p> <p> He slowed, cautious, found a hiding place behind a massive fallen fir, and peered ahead. </p> <p> Just a few yards beyond him, the forest had been shorn open by a logging operation, a wide swath of open ground littered with forest debris and freshly sawn tree stumps. A dirt road cut through it all, a house-sized pile of limbs and slash awaited burning, and on the far side of the clearing, a hulking, yellow bulldozer sat cold and silent, its tracks caked with fresh earth. A huge pile of logs lay neatly stacked near the road, ready for the logging trucks. </p> <p> He saw no movement, and the only sound was the quiet rumble of a battered pickup truck idling near the center of the clearing. </p> <p> He waited, crouching, eyes level with the top of the fallen tree, scanning the clearing, searching for the human beings who had to be there. But no one appeared and the truck just kept idling. </p> <p> His gaze flitted from the truck to the bulldozer, then to the huge pile of logs, and then to the truck again where something protruding from behind the truck's front wheels caught his eye. He grabbed a compact pair of binoculars from a pocket and took a closer look. </p> <p> The protrusion was a man's arm, motionless and streaked with red. </p> <p> Looking about, the Hunter waited just a few more seconds and then, satisfied that no one else was there, he climbed over the log and stole into the clearing, stepping carefully from rock to stump to patch of grass, trying to avoid any soil that would register his footprints. The truck was parked in nothing but loose soil, freshly chewed by the bulldozer, but he would have to deal with that problem later. He was planning his moves as he went along. </p> <p> He reached the truck, slowed with caution, and then eased around it, neck craning, in no mood for gruesome surprises. </p> <p> What he found on the other side was no surprise, but it was gruesome, and definitely a complication. Cursing, he leaned against the truck's hood, warily scanned the tree line and the logging road, and started weighing his options. </p> <p> The crumpled body on the ground was obviously one of the logging crew, most likely the foreman who'd lingered alone too long on the site the previous evening, judging from the stiff condition of his body. He lay on his belly in the dirt, his body crushed, dried blood streaked from his nose and mouth, his head twisted grotesquely on a broken neck. His hard hat lay top down several feet away, and the ground around the truck was littered with metal shreds of what used to be a lunch box and scattered, chewed-up plastic wrappings that used to hold a lunch. </p> <p><em> I don't have time for this! </em></p> <p> The Hunter quickly stifled his rage. He needed to calculate, foresee, plan. </p> <p> His gaze shifted to the pile of logs. That might be an option. He could make it look like an accident that would explain the bent, torn, rag-doll condition of the dead man. </p> <p> Were the keys in the bulldozer? </p> <p> Leaving his rifle by the truck, the Hunter ran to the bulldozer, clambered up on the big steel track, and stepped into the cab. He sank into the worn and torn driver's seat and searched the panel for the keys. Then he sniffed a chuckle of realization: Of course. This wasn't in town, where idle punks drifted about looking to steal anything not locked up or bolted down, and this machine was no car for joyriding. The key was in the ignition. </p> <p> It had been a while since his college summers with the construction crew, but if this thing was anything like that track hoe he used to operate . . . </p> <p> He clicked the key over to <em>Preheat</em>, waited, then turned the key to <em>Start</em>. </p> <p> The dozer cranked to life with a puff of black smoke. </p> <p> His mind was racing, still planning, as he put the mountainous machine into gear and got it moving. Reverse came easily enough. Forward was easier. With careful manipulation of the brakes and levers, he brought the dozer to the back of the log pile, then left it there, still running. </p> <p> Hauling the dead man across the ground would be messy, but it was the only option. The Hunter grabbed the man's wrists--the right arm was intact, but the left arm had been snapped above the elbow and flexed like a rubber hose--and started pulling. He tugged and dragged the body over limbs, grass, rocks, and debris. The man's head dangled from a wrung neck and scraped on the ground. When the Hunter reached the front of the log pile, he let go of the arms. The stiffened body flopped into the dust. </p> <p> Seated once again in the dozer, he edged the machine forward, reaching under the logs with the bucket. With a calculating, steady pull of the lever, he raised the bucket, lifting the logs, lifting, lifting, until . . . </p> <p> The pile upset. The logs rolled and rumbled down, bouncing, tumbling one over the other, drumming the ground, kicking up dust. </p> <p> The dead man's body disappeared beneath a jackstraw pile of logs. </p> <p><em> No time, no time!</em> The Hunter eased the dozer back to its resting place, switched it off, and leaped to the ground. He ran back to the idling truck and pocketed every metal scrap, every torn plastic wrapper he could find. Then, slinging his rifle over his shoulder, he spotted and grabbed a broken-off evergreen bough and went to work, retracing his every step, brushing and erasing each footprint with rapid side-sweeps as he backed out of the clearing. </p> <p> As expected, he heard the slowly rising sound of a vehicle coming up the logging road, climbing switchbacks, lurching through gears, rattling over potholes, and growling over gravel. </p> <p> He crouched and headed for the trees, tossing away the branch. Just as he slipped into the forest, a truck pulled into the clearing on the other side. He stole through the crowded timber, planting every footstep silently in the soft, pine-needled ground. Truck doors slammed. Voices lifted, followed by cries of alarm. Those loggers were going to have quite a morning.</p></p><h2>Nerve: the First Ten Years: Essays, Interviews, Fiction and Photography</h2><p>Way back in the early days of the internet, Nerve.com challenged the best writers and photographers of the generation to create work that was explicit in both senses of the word: honest and sexy.

When the guide told me that this was the bed in which Queen Elizabeth slept, I believed him. When owners of country cottages in Suffolk told me their cottage was a thousand years old, I believed them too. I thought that this or that church was the smallest in England, and that secret passages ran under ruined monasteries, so that monks could get to the nearest convent without being seen. The older anything was the lovelier I thought it.&#39; Most famous for his poetry, John Betjeman was also passionate about architecture, &#39;preferring all centuries to my own&#39;. In his first prose work, Ghastly Good Taste (1933), he vigorously defends his love of Victorian and Edwardian architecture, considered deeply unfashionable at the time. With the savage humour of his famous satire &#39;Slough&#39;, he attacks notions of Modernism and (at the other extreme) unthinking antiquarianism.</p><p>Poet and architectural critic, Sir John Betjeman was born in North London in 1906. He was taught by T S Eliot at Highgate Junior School and was rusticated from Magdalen College Oxford for failing Divinity.

Some may object to his refusal to treat the miraculous as historical, but his insistence on historical objectivity is one of the book's many strengths. Pulling Peter out from the shadow of the apostle Paul, Grant provides a good, clear review of the available sources and a detailed historical background, making it all easy to follow. He highlights Peter's pivotal role in resuscitating Jesus' small band of followers after the crucifixion and suggests that his biblical subordination to Paul was born of the latter's jealousy. Against this, the author also reasons that James was more prominent than Peter among Jewish Christians and that Peter was more likely a missionary to Rome than the leader of that city's church. Grant wisely avoids assessing tradition's claim on Peter as the first pope, and while he admits that his book reports little not written elsewhere, his skill is in bringing so much previous scholarship together in one relatively brief volume.

You and I are simply one. Neither of us can be described without the other.&#39;It was unthinkable that Pierre and Francoise should ever tire of each other. And yet, both talented and restless, they constantly feel the need for new sensations, new people. Because of this they bring the young, beautiful and irresponsible Xaviere into their life who, determined to take Pierre for herself, drives a wedge between them, with unforeseeable, disastrous consequences...Published in 1943, &#39;She Came to Stay&#39; is Simone de Beauvoir&#39;s first novel. Written as an act of revenge against the woman who nearly destroyed her now legendary, unorthodox relationship with the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, it fictionalises the events of 1935, when Sartre became infatuated with seventeen-year old Olga Bost, a pupil and devotee of de Beauvoir&#39;s.Passionately eloquent, coolly and devastatingly ironic, &#39;She Came to Stay&#39; is one of the most extraordinary and powerful pieces of fictional autobiography of the twentieth century, in which de Beauvoir&#39;s &#39;tears for her characters freeze as they drop.&#39;</p><p>Simon de Beauvoir was born in Paris in 1908. A close friend of the writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Satre, and well-known as a leader of the Existentialist movement in Paris, her novels have won wide acclaim throughout the world. Her famous work, The Second Sex, was hailed as a landmark study of women, and her novels, including The Woman Destroyed and She Came to Stay, have become well-loved classics.

Felicity has never much liked her father, and to have him as a near-neighbor fills her with foreboding. The boorish old man has always loved to impress the ladies, young and old, by exaggerating his modest success as a novelist. True to form, soon after his move to Slepton Edge he surrounds himself with adoring females, including a precocious, theatrical teenager named Anne Michaels. Rupert and Anne could make a lethal combination. <br> <br> Rumors fly, but Felicity convinces herself that Rupert would do nothing seriously wrong. He can be annoying and outrageous but he's not a criminal. She relies on a friend, a doctor who seems to be strangely aware of everything that's happening in the community, to warn her if he hears of anything really troubling. She doesn't have long to wait, but the news is not what she expects. It's worse. A body has been found and it looks like murder. Stunned by a difficult reality, Felicity is even more shocked to discover that she, herself, may be a suspect. <br> <br> This is one criminal investigation that's much too close to home for Charlie Peace. He's not officially on the case, but he uses his copper's instincts and a husband's heart to find a killer and to discover anew the meaning of family. <br> <br> Praised for his "perfect pitch, exquisite pacing, and meticulous plotting" (Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times</i>), Robert Barnard proves yet again that he is one of the great masters of mystery.</p><p>Robert Barnard (1936-2013) was awarded the Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement and the Nero Wolfe Award, as well as the Agatha and Macavity awards. An eight-time Edgar nominee, he was a member of Britain's distinguished Detection Club, and, in May 2003, he received the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for lifetime achievement in mystery writing. His most recent novel, <i>Charitable Body</i>, was published by Scribner in 2012.*Starred Review* Barnard, who has won just about every mystery award there is, including the Malice Domestic Lifetime Achievement Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award, never falls from grace. His writing (in almost 40 novels to date) is always stiletto sharp, his observations darkly witty, his plotting perniciously surprising. In his latest, Leeds cop Charlie Peace (who goes back to <i>The Bad </i>Samaritan,<i></i>1995) is a newly made inspector, relocating with his wife to the village of Slepton Edge, a move somewhat darkened by the parallel move of Peace's detested father-in-law to a house nearby. Barnard takes full advantage of village atmosphere, with characters revealing secrets about themselves and others in the local pub. Peace and his wife, Felicity, learn that her father had to leave his former village hurriedly, after he struck a young woman. And now the old man is hitting on a teenage girl. Before the Peaces have a chance to figure out how to protect her, the old man is found dead at the bottom of a quarry. Suspects abound, including a clutch of murderous children and Felicity herself. Peace moves into full detective mode with a murder on his doorstep and his wife a prime suspect. This very satisfying riff on the traditional village mystery finds Barnard at the top of his game. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Three ever widening domains are presented--the planets, the stars, and the large scale universe itself--each including the ones before it and extending outward.<br><br>The tour starts close to home within the first domain, our own solar system. There is a tremendous variety here, from the sun scorched rocks of Mercury to the icy vastness of the Kuiper Belt beyond Pluto. We see the sun and planets born from the collapse of an interstellar dust cloud whose atoms were themselves created in long dead stars. Since many of these planets have been visited by space probes or landers, we are able to benefit from the incredible technology of exploration developed by NASA and its counterparts in other countries.<br><br>The second domain is made up of the billions of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy. We walk in the steps of the American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who first established that the universe is made up of discrete galaxies, then go on to examine the fundamental constituents of those galaxies--the stars. We see stars not as eternal lights in the sky, but as objects born out of a desperate struggle between pressure and gravity. We trace the life cycle of our own sun, from its birth 4.5 billion years ago to its quiet end 6 billion years in the future. We see the galaxy not as a serene and placid place, but as a giant factory, where primordial material is taken up into stars, then returned to the galaxy enriched with the heavy elements necessary for life.<br><br>Finally, we move to the ultimate domain--the large scale structure of the universe itself in which galaxies are the building blocks. We discover the most amazing fact, that the solid stuff of stars and planets on which we have been concentrating up to this point make up only a few percent of the mass in the universe, with the rest being composed of two mysterious entities called, respectively, dark matter and dark energy. We descend into deep caverns to see scientists trying to detect dark matter as it sweeps by the Earth, and we talk to theorists trying to solve the riddle of dark energy. This quest brings us to the frontier of knowledge, the edge of the unknown.<br><br>To conclude, two ultimate questions remain: How did the universe begin? How will the universe end? We trace our theories back to the first fraction of a second of the life of the universe and listen to the speculations of cosmologists about how it might all have started.</p><p><p><b>Featured Photos from <em>Space Atlas</em></b></p> <em>An infared image of the Helix Nebula, taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Going beyond the premise of managing in one-minute chunks, the broader lessons are the values that get expressed in those minutes--such as respecting people, providing emotional security for them, setting reasonable but challenging goals, and expecting them to develop excellent work habits. There's also the value of being concise in all communication, which confining one's input to one-minute chunks certainly facilitates. The lessons are both simple and profound, and are crafted and expressed with as much elegance as any management advice I've heard in the years since they first appeared.

Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees "a fortune beyond counting" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter--Annawadi's "most-everything girl"--will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call "the full enjoy." <br> But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi. <br> With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, "Behind the Beautiful Forevers "carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2012</strong>: Katherine Boo spent three years among the residents of the Annawadi slum, a sprawling, cockeyed settlement of more than 300 tin-roof huts and shacks in the shadow of Mumbai&#x2019;s International Airport. From within this &#x201c;sumpy plug of slum&#x201d; Boo unearths stories both tragic and poignant--about residents&#x2019; efforts to raise families, earn a living, or simply survive. These unforgettable characters all nurture far-fetched dreams of a better life. As one boy tells his brother: &#x201c;Everything around us is roses.

Now, in her vividly imagined World War I novels, Perry&#x2019;s talents &#x201c;have taken a quantum leap&#x201d; (The Star-Ledger), and so has the number of her devoted readers. We Shall Not Sleep, the final book in this epic series featuring the dedicated Reavley family, is perhaps the most memorably enthralling of all Perry&#x2019;s novels.<br><br>After four long years, peace is finally in sight. But chaplain Joseph Reavley and his sister Judith, an ambulance driver on the Western Front, are more hard pressed than ever. Behind the lines, violence is increasing: soldiers are abusing German prisoners, a nurse has been raped and murdered, and the sinister ideologue called the Peacemaker now threatens to undermine the peace just as he did the war.<br><br>Then Matthew, the third Reavley sibling and an intelligence expert, suddenly arrives at the front with startling news. The Peacemaker&#x2019;s German counterpart has offered to go to England and expose his co-conspirator as a traitor. But with war still raging and prejudices inflamed, such a journey would be fraught with hazards, especially since the Peacemaker has secret informers everywhere, even on the battlefield.<br><br>For richness of plot, character, and feeling, We Shall Not Sleep is unmatched. Anne Perry&#x2019;s brilliantly orchestrated finale is a heartstopping tour de force, mesmerizing and totally satisfying.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of the World War I novels No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, Angels in the Gloom, and At Some Disputed Barricade; as well as four holiday novels: A Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, A Christmas Guest, and A Christmas Secret.

He turned his back to the wind and lit a Woodbine, then flicked the match into the mud at his feet. A couple of miles away in the gathering dusk the German guns fired desultorily. In a little while the shelling would probably get heavier. Nights were the worst.<br><br>"Maybe." Joseph would not commit himself. In October 1914 they had all imagined that the war would be over in months. Now, four years later, the situation was dramatically different. Half the men he had known then were dead; the German army was in retreat from the ground it had taken, and Joseph's Cambridgeshire regiment had advanced nearly as far as Ypres again. They might even make it tonight, so every man was needed.<br><br>They were waiting now, all around him in the gathering darkness, fidgeting a little, adjusting the weight of rifles and packs on their shoulders. They knew this land well. Before the Germans had driven them back they had lived in these trenches and dugouts. Friends and brothers were buried in the thick Flanders clay around them.<br><br>Barshey shifted his weight, his feet squelching in the mud. His brother Charlie had been mutilated and bled to death here shortly after the first gas attacks in the spring of 1915. Tucky Nunn was buried here somewhere, and Plugger Arnold, and dozens more from the small villages around St. Giles.<br><br>There was movement to his left, and to his right. They were waiting for the order to go over the top. Joseph would stay behind, as he always did, ready to tend the wounded, carry them back to the Casualty Clearing Station, sit with those whose pain was unbearable, and wait with the dying. His days were too often spent writing the letters home that told women they were widows. Lately the soldiers were younger, some no more than fifteen or sixteen, and he was telling their mothers how they died, trying to offer some kind of comfort: that they had been brave, liked, and not alone, that it had been quick.<br><br>In his pocket Joseph's hand tightened over the letter he had received that morning from his sister Hannah at home in Cambridgeshire, but he refused to open it yet. Memories could confuse him, taking him miles from the present and scattering the concentration he needed to stay alive. He could not think of evening wind in the poplar leaves beyond the orchard, or across the fields the elms motionless against a sunset sky, starlings wheeling up and out, black fragments against the light. He could not allow himself to breathe in the silence and the smell of earth, or watch the slow tread of the plow horses returning along the lanes after the day's work.<br><br>There were weeks to go yet, perhaps months, before it was over and those who were left could go back to a land that would never again be as they had left it.<br><br>More men were passing through the shadows. Allied trenches were dug more shallowly than the German ones. You had to keep your head down or risk being caught by sniper fire. The earthen floor was always muddy, though not as bad now as times he could remember when the ooze had been deep enough to drown a man, and so cold some actually froze to death. Many of the duckboards were rotted now, but the rats were still there, millions of them, some as big as cats, and the stench was always the same--death and latrines. You could smell the line miles before you actually reached it. It varied from one place to another, depending on the nationality of the men who fought there. Corpses smelled differently according to the food the men had eaten.<br><br>Barshey threw away the last of his cigarette. "Reckon we'll make Passchendaele again within the week," he said, looking at Joseph and squinting slightly in the last of the light.<br><br>Joseph said nothing, knowing no answer was expected. Memory held them together in wordless pain. He nodded, looked at Barshey for a moment, then turned to pick his way over the old duckboards and around the dogleg corner into the next stretch. All the trenches were built in a zigzag so that if the enemy did storm them, they could not take out a whole platoon with one burst. The wooden revetting that held back the crumbling walls was sagged and bulging.<br><br>Joseph reached Tiddly Wop Andrews just below the fire step. The young soldier's handsome profile with its quiff of dark hair was clear for a moment against the pale sky; then he ducked down again.<br>" 'Evenin', Reverend," Andrews said quietly. He started to say something else, but the increasing noise drowned it out as a hundred yards to the left the machine guns started to chatter.<br><br>It was time for Joseph to go back to the Casualty Clearing Station, where he could be of use to the wounded as they were brought in. He passed other men he knew and spoke a word or two to them: Snowy Nunn, his white-blond hair hidden by his helmet; Stan Tidyman, grinning and whistling through his teeth; Punch Fuller, instantly recognizable by his nose; and Cully Teversham, standing motionless.<br><br>Like every regiment, the Cambridgeshires had originally been drawn from a small area: These men had played together in childhood and gone to the same schools. But with so many dead or wounded, remnants of many regiments had been scrambled together to make any kind of force. More than half the soldiers now going up and over the parapet into the roar of gunfire were almost strangers to him.<br><br>Joseph came to the end of the dogleg and turned into the connecting trench back toward the support line and the station beyond. It was dark by the time he reached it. Normally the station would not have been busy. The wounded were evacuated to the hospital as soon as they were fit to move, and the surgeons, nurses, and orderlies would be waiting for new casualties to be brought in. But with so many German prisoners pouring through the lines, exhausted, defeated, and many of them injured, there were still nearly twenty patients here.<br><br>In the distance more columns of soldiers were marching forward into the trenches. At the rate they were taking ground now, the front line would soon move beyond the old earthworks, abandoned in the retreat. In the open the casualties would be far worse.<br><br>Joseph began his usual work of helping with more minor injuries. He was busy in the General Admissions tent when Whoopy Teversham came to the open flap, his face frightened and smeared with blood in the lantern light.<br><br>"Captain Reavley, you'd better come. There's two o' the men beating a prisoner pretty bad. If you don't stop 'em they're loike to kill 'im."<br><br>Joseph shouted for one of the orderlies to take over from him and followed Whoopy outside, almost treading on the man's heels. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the dark; then he started running toward the pale outline of the Operating tent. The ground was rough, gouged into ruts and shallow craters by gun-carriage wheels and earlier shelling.<br><br>They were ahead of him, a group of half a dozen or so crowded together--lightly wounded men on guard duty. Their voices were sharp and high-pitched. He saw them jostle closer, an arm swing in a punch, and someone stagger. A star shell went up and momentarily lit the sky, outlining them luridly for several seconds before it faded and fell. It gave him long enough to see the figure on the ground, half curled over with his face in the mud.<br><br>He reached them and spoke to the only man he had recognized in the brief light. "Corporal Clarke, what's going on here?"<br><br>The others froze, caught by surprise.<br><br>Clarke coughed, then straightened up. "German prisoner, sir. Seems to be hurt." His voice was uncertain, and Joseph could not see his face in the dark.<br><br>"Seems to be?" Joseph said scathingly. "Then what are you doing standing around shouting at each other and throwing punches? Does he need a stretcher?"<br><br>" 'E's a Jerry prisoner!" someone said angrily. "Best put him out of his misery. Bastards spent four years killing our boys, then think they can just put their hands up in the air, and suddenly we'll bust our guts bandaging 'em up and looking after 'em. Oi say the war's still on. Their brothers are over there"--he jerked an arm toward the gunfire--"still troying to kill us. Let's shoot back."<br><br>There was a measure of agreement in murmured angry voices.<br><br>"Very brave," Joseph said sarcastically. "Ten of you kick an unarmed prisoner to death while your comrades go into no-man's-land and face the Germans with guns."<br><br>"We found him loike that!" The sense of injustice was hot and instant. Others agreed vehemently.<br><br>" 'E was escaping!" someone explained. "Going off back to 'is own to tell 'em where we are, an' how many. We had to stop 'im!"<br><br>"Name?" Joseph demanded.<br><br>"Turner."<br><br>"Turner, sir!" Joseph snapped.<br><br>"Turner, sir," the man replied sullenly. " 'E was still escaping." The resentment in his voice was clear. Joseph was a chaplain, a noncombatant, and Turner obviously considered him inferior. Joseph had now compounded that attitude with his holy-Joe interference, interrupting natural justice.<br><br>"And it takes ten of you to stop him?" Joseph inquired, allowing his voice to rise with disbelief.<br><br>"Two of us," Turner replied. "Me an' Culshaw."<br><br>"Go and join your unit," Joseph ordered. "Teversham and I will get him to the dressing station."<br><br>Turner did not move. "He's German, sir--"<br><br>"So you said. We don't kill unarmed prisoners. If it's worth bothering, we question them; if not, we leave them alone."<br><br>Someone muttered a remark Joseph did not hear. There was a ripple of jerky laughter, then silence.<br>Whoopy Teversham leveled his bayonet and poked the man nearest him. Reluctantly the group moved aside, and Joseph bent to the figure on the ground. The man was still breathing, but he...</p><h2>Understanding Your Life Thru Color: Metaphysical Concepts in Color and Aura</h2><p>Your Aura * Your Life Color * And Your Life Lesson.

"Old Matthew Wheelock" painstakingly chooses and arranges the stones "like a giant puzzle," creating a wall strong enough to last "years in and out" so that it may be enjoyed by his grandchildren and the animals who nest within its cracks. Weller's beguilingly spare prose--only occasionally jarred by statements like "this wall's my monument!"--is further enhanced by images of grandchildren who "duel like knights and pirates." Lewin's unframed, full-spread paintings engender nostalgia--in muted grays, greens and browns, they portray an elderly Matthew in his workclothes laboring on the wall as vast expanses of land spread out beyond him. This thoughtful book, with its subtle message about care and endurance, will encourage readers to consider the legacies in their own lives. Ages 5-8. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 3-- Matthew Wheelock clears his fields for planting, and with the many rocks he builds a stone wall. It rings his pastures like a ``stone necklace''; built to last, it provides a home for wildlife and a source of play and pride for future generations. There's a light message that the world is like this wall, with its interdependence of things large and small. Lewin's artwork adds substance to the poetic text; the rocks are rich with light and shadow, and the pages are spacious and long, echoing the wall. Building a stone wall can, oddly enough, be a contemplative experience, and the book honors that, but this isn't a story with clear child appeal. It is a worthy homage to the farmers whose work, happily, is still in evidence.<br><i>-Leda Schubert, Vermont Department of Education</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Roderick Alleyn Mysteries: The Nursing Home Murder; Death in a White Tie; Final Curtain</h2><p>For one unlucky Member of Parliament, a simple visit to the hospital (the nursing home of the title) proves fatal.

The young leads inhabit Christian romance fiction clich�s: Cody Gunner is the ruggedly handsome outdoorsman with a painful past (his backstory, as it happens, is identical to that of the male lead in Susan May Warren's <i>Happily Ever After</i>) and Ali Daniels is the daintily beautiful yet doggedly determined young cowgirl who wins his heart. Both characters are driven to succeed by a need to overcome hidden pain. Cody has suffered from besetting anger at both of his parents since the day his father left the family because he was unable to handle Cody's brother's Down syndrome. Ali, on the other hand, secretly has cystic fibrosis, and she rides in horse races despite the dust, hay and allergens associated with her sport, which will shorten her already brief life expectancy. When these two predictably fall in love, they provide each other with some measure of healing before the novel reaches its telegraphed conclusion. Despite the plot's limitations, Kingsbury fans will undoubtedly be pleased by more of the inspirational fiction for which this author has become beloved. <i>(Apr. 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has acquired a completely unexpected child, a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.<p>Barbara Kingsolver's work has been translated into more than twenty languages and has earned a devoted readership at home and abroad.

She and her husband, Earl, live in the mountains of North Carolina.Best of series, this 17th The Cat Who caper slyly creeps up on the reader. The newest delight in Moose County, "400 miles north of everywhere," is a railroad buff's refurbished locomotive, which is making its debut run. Floyd Trevelyan, the train owner, disappears just as the state closes down the credit union associated with his business. While others believe the man has decamped with investors' money, newspaper columnist Jim Qwilleran doesn't believe Trevelyan would abandon his railroad project. He persuades his friend and sleuthing cohort Celia, recently moved to Pickax City from Chicago, to go undercover to find the missing businessman. Meanwhile, librarian Polly Duncan, with whom Qwill has had a long-standing relationship, is becoming distraught about the house she is building nearby. After a carpenter on the project is stabbed in a barroom brawl and the contractor, Trevelyan's son, is seriously injured on the job, Qwill begins to fear for Polly's health. Qwill's Siamese cat, Koko, plays a central role in solving these puzzles as Qwill struggles equally to interpret the cat's hints and cope with those problems complicating his personal life.

Growing up as a good boy in the grip of a domineering mother, he trains as a doctor, marries, opens a medical practice in a quiet country town, and settles into an existence of impeccable bourgeois conformity.

It is time for the sleeper to awake.</p><p>Georges Simenon (1903&#x2013;1989) was born in Li�ge, Belgium. He went to work as a reporter at the age of fifteen and in 1923 moved to Paris, where under various pseudonyms he became a highly successful and prolific author of pulp fiction while leading a dazzling social life. In the early 1930s, Simenon emerged as a writer under his own name, gaining renown for his detective stories featuring Inspector Maigret. He also began to write his psychological novels, or <i>romans durs</i>&#x2014;books in which he displays a sympathetic awareness of the emotional and spiritual pain underlying the routines of daily life. Having written nearly two hundred books under his own name and become the best-selling author in the world, Simenon retired as a novelist in 1973, devoting himself instead to dictating several volumes of memoirs.<br><br>Louise Var�se (1891&#x2013;1989) was an American writer and translator. In 1969 she was designated a Chevalier de L&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Republic of France in recognition of her translations of Baudelaire, Sartre, Proust, Michaux, and Bernanos, among other writers. She and her husband, the composer Edgard Var�se, were close friends of Georges Simenon during his years in the United States, and she translated some fifteen of his novels.<br><br>Roger Ebert has been the film critic of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i>since 1967.

The author shares peoples names, companies, government organizations, national and international groups that have had their fingers in this deliberate process over the years. It is very disturbing. Some of them were people you would have thought you could trust. The main agenda (cutting through all the smoke and mirrors) is to make the people lemming-like so that they will follow the &#34;enlightened&#34; toward a global, godless, Marxist-like society. Their plan has been (and still is) to do it incrementally in tiny steps, so that most people won&#39;t notice. They have been extremely successful, because the media and the government (both major parties and a few minor parties) endorse the agenda and cheer it on (some know exactly what they are doing while others are blind, but think they are doing the right thing). The tendency is to think that everyone else was dumbed down except yourself. Anyone who is willing to read this is likely less affected than the masses, but you will find that almost no one educated in America over the last 100+ years has finished their education years with a &#34;pure education,&#34; but it&#39;s been especially bad in the more recent years.

Jurassic postcard laid in.</p><p>Jasper Fforde is the author of the critically acclaimed &#39;Eyre Affair&#39;. After a varied career in the film industry, he now lives and works in Wales and has a passion for aviation.I didn&#x2019;t ask to be a celebrity. I never wanted to appear on The Adrian Lush Show. And let&#x2019;s get one thing straight right now &#x2013; the world would have to be hurtling towards imminent destruction before I&#x2019;d agree to anything as dopey as The Thursday Next Workout Video.<p>The publicity surrounding the successful rebookment of Jane Eyre was fun to begin with but rapidly grew wearisome. I happily posed for photocalls, agreed to newspaper interviews, hesitantly appeared on Desert Island Smells and was thankfully excused the embarrassment of Celebrity Name That Fruit! The public, ever fascinated by celebrity, had wanted to know everything about me following my excursion within the pages of Jane Eyre, and since the Special Operations Network have a PR record on a par with that of Vlad the Impaler, the top brass thought it would be a good wheeze to use me to boost their flagging popularity. I dutifully toured all points of the globe doing signings, library openings, talks and interviews. The same questions, the same SpecOps-approved answers. Supermarket openings, literary dinners, offers of book deals. I even met the actress Lola Vavoom, who said that she would simply adore to play me if there were a film. It was tiring, but more than that &#x2013; it was dull. For the first time in my career at the Literary Detectives I actually missed authenticating Milton.</p><p>I&#x2019;d taken a week&#x2019;s leave as soon my tour ended so Landen and I could devote some time to married life. I moved all my stuff to his house, rearranged his furniture, added my books to his and introduced my dodo, Pickwick, to his new home. Landen and I ceremoniously partitioned the bedroom closet space, decided to share the sock drawer, then had an argument over who was to sleep on the wall side of the bed. We had long and wonderfully pointless conversations about nothing in particular, walked Pickwick in the park, went out to dinner, stayed in for dinner, stared at each other a lot and slept in late every morning. It was wonderful.</p><p>On the fourth day of my leave, just between lunch with Landen&#x2019;s mum and Pickwick&#x2019;s notable first fight with the neighbour&#x2019;s cat, I got a call from Cordelia Flakk. She was the senior SpecOps PR agent here in Swindon and she told me that Adrian Lush wanted me on his show. I wasn&#x2019;t mad keen on the idea &#x2013; or the show. But there was an upside. The Adrian Lush Show went out live and Flakk assured me that this would be a &#x2018;no holds barred&#x2019; interview, something that held a great deal of appeal. Despite my many appearances, the true story about Jane Eyre was yet to be told &#x2013; and I had been wanting to drop the Goliath Corporation in it for quite a while. Flakk&#x2019;s assurance that this would finally be the end of the press junket clinched my decision. Adrian Lush it would be.</p><p>I travelled up to the Network Toad studios a few days later on my own; Landen had a deadline looming and needed to get his head down. But I wasn&#x2019;t alone for long. As soon as I stepped into the large entrance lobby a milk-curdling shade of green strode purposefully towards me.</p><p>&#x2018;Thursday, darling!&#x2019; cried Cordelia, beads rattling. &#x2018;So glad you could make it!&#x2019;</p><p>The SpecOps dress code stated that our apparel should be &#x2018;dignified&#x2019; but in Cordelia&#x2019;s case they had obviously stretched a point. Anyone looking less like a serving officer was impossible to imagine. Looks, in her case, were highly deceptive. She was SpecOps all the way from her high heels to the pink-and-yellow scarf tied in her hair.<br><br>She air-kissed me affectionately.<br><br>&#x2018;How was New Zealand?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Green and full of sheep,&#x2019; I replied. &#x2018;I brought you this.&#x2019;<br><br>I handed her a fluffy toy lamb that bleated realistically when you turned it upside down.<br><br>&#x2018;How adorable!

I haven&#x2019;t done anything with my hair!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Exactly!&#x2019; replied Flakk quickly. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s so incredibly you.&#x2019;<br><br>She did a twirl.<br><br>&#x2018;What do you think of the outfit?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;One&#x2019;s attention is drawn straight to it,&#x2019; I replied ambiguously.<br><br>&#x2018;This is 1985,&#x2019; she explained, &#x2018;bright colours are the future. I&#x2019;ll let you loose in my wardrobe one day.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I think I&#x2019;ve got some pink socks of my own somewhere.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a start, my dear. Listen, you&#x2019;ve been a star about all this publicity work; I&#x2019;m very grateful &#x2013; and so is SpecOps.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Grateful enough to post me somewhere other than the Literary Detectives?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well,&#x2019; murmured Cordelia reflectively, &#x2018;first things first. As soon as you&#x2019;ve done the Lush interview your transfer application will be aggressively considered, you have my word on that.&#x2019;<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t sound terribly promising. Despite the successes at work, I still wanted to move up within the Network. Cordelia took my arm and steered me towards the waiting area.<br><br>&#x2018;Coffee?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Spot of bother in Auckland?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Bronte Federation offshoot caused a bit of trouble,&#x2019; I explained.<br><br>&#x2018;They didn&#x2019;t like the new ending of Jane Eyre.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;There&#x2019;ll always be a few malcontents,&#x2019; observed Flakk. &#x2018;Milk?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Thanks.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh,&#x2019; she said, staring at the milk jug, &#x2018;this milk&#x2019;s off. No matter. Listen,&#x2019; she went on quietly, &#x2018;I&#x2019;d love to stay and watch but some SpecOps 17 clot in Penzance staked a Goth by mistake; it&#x2019;s going to be PR hell on earth down there.&#x2019;<br><br>SO-17 were the vampire and werewolf disposal squad.

Reissue.</p><p>Sharyn McCrumb is one of the major wonders of the mystery world. Her books about forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson (including <i>Highland Laddie Gone</i>) are strong, meaty contemporary stories; her comic novels (<i>Bimbos of the Death Sun</i>, <i>Zombies of the Gene Pool</i>) are delightful satires. And then there's the jewel in her crown, the series known as the Ballad novels (including <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i> and <i>The Rosewood Casket</i>) where the third-generation Appalachian resident McCrumb sews together what she calls "colored scraps of legends, ballads and fragments of rural life and local tragedy" into books that are like Appalachian quilts. <i>The Ballad of Frankie Silver</i> is the fifth in the Ballad series, and it might well be the best. The blend between the old story and the new is perfect, as Sheriff Spencer Arrowood digs into the 1832 case of the first woman ever hanged for murder in North Carolina--18-year-old Frankie Silver, charged with dismembering her husband--while some disturbing new evidence is surfacing about another, much more recent capital crime. If you have friends who don't read mysteries but liked <i>Cold Mountain</i>, pointing them toward McCrumb might be the start of something big. <i>--Dick Adler</i><p>Sharyn McCrumb is the author of <i>The Rosewood Casket,</i> <i>She Walks These Hills,</i> and many other acclaimed novels.&nbsp;Her books have been named Notable Books of the Year by <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

Protected in a clear poly sleeve.</p><p></p><h2>The Elephant and the Lotus: Vietnamese Ceramics in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</h2><p>For more than 2000 years, using the excellent clays of the Red River Valley, Vietnamese potters have produced some of the most sophisticated ceramic artifacts in Southeast Asia, dovetailing the Chinese ceramic tradition with other traditions--such as those of Cambodia and Champa--in original and idiosyncratic ways. The combination of skilled potting with somewhat "casual" finish, calligraphic painting and certain chance effects in glazing are all qualities typical of Vietnamese ceramics. Today, partly prompted by several recent archaeological retrievals, these qualities are stimulating the interest of a widening circle of collectors and connoisseurs. <i>The Elephant and the Lotus: Vietnamese Ceramics in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</i> considers this vital and hitherto obscured tradition by highlighting over 200 examples from the Museum's superb collection. Ranging from earthy and practical stoneware produced over two millennia ago (the earliest Vietnamese potteries date back to the Hung period in 700 B.C.), to the gloriously decorated ewers and bowls created a thousand years later, or to the fine blue-and-white porcelains produced between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries (before the advent of French colonial rule), the works gathered here reflect the natural wonders of Vietnam and the ingenuity of its ceramists. With extensive presentations by expert Philippe Truong, including an essay on the natural motifs particular to Vietnamese pottery, <i>The Elephant and the Lotus</i> is both the first complete publication of a remarkable collection and an indispensable introduction to a rapidly growing field of study in Asian decorative arts.</p><p></p><h2>The Old Dominion in the Seventeenth Century: A Documentary History of Virginia, 1606-1689 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American ... and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

It was Zhukov who saved Leningrad from capture by the Wehrmacht in September 1941, Zhukov who led the defense of Moscow in October 1941, Zhukov who spearheaded the Red Army&#x2019;s march on Berlin and formally accepted Germany&#x2019;s unconditional surrender in the spring of 1945. Drawing on the latest research from recently opened Soviet archives, including the uncensored versions of Zhukov&#x2019;s own memoirs, Roberts offers a vivid portrait of a man whose tactical brilliance was matched only by the cold-blooded ruthlessness with which he pursued his battlefield objectives.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the war, Zhukov was a key player on the geopolitical scene. As Khrushchev&#x2019;s defense minister, he was one of the architects of Soviet military strategy during the Cold War. While lauded in the West as a folk hero&#x2014;he was the only Soviet general ever to appear on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2014;Zhukov repeatedly ran afoul of the Communist political authorities.

Zhukov, mounted on a magnificent white Arabian called Tspeki, rode into the square through the Spassky Gate, the Kremlin on his right and the famous onion domes of St. Basil&#x2019;s Cathedral directly ahead. As he did so a 1,400-strong orchestra struck up Glinka&#x2019;s Glory (to the Russian Motherland). Awaiting him were columns of combined regiments representing all the branches of the Soviet armed forces. In the middle of the square Zhukov met Marshal K. K. Rokossovsky, who called the parade to attention and then escorted Zhukov as he rode to each regiment and saluted them.<br><br>When the salutes were finished Zhukov joined the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on the plinth above Lenin&#x2019;s Mausoleum and gave a speech celebrating the Red Army&#x2019;s victory over Nazi Germany. The sky was overcast and there was a drizzling rain that worsened as the day wore on. At one point Zhukov&#x2019;s hat became so wet he was tempted to remove it and wipe the visor but desisted when he saw that Stalin was making no such move.<br><br>As a former cavalryman Zhukov relished the salute portion of the proceedings. Giving a speech that would be seen and heard by millions of people across the world was a different matter. The idea made him anxious and he prepared as thoroughly as he could, even rehearsing the speech in front of his daughters Era and Ella, who were so impressed they burst into spontaneous applause. The delivery of the speech was carefully crafted, with prompts in the margin directing Zhukov to speak quietly, then louder, and when to adopt a solemn tone.<br><br>Zhukov seemed more than a little nervous but it was a commanding performance nonetheless. His delivery was halting but emphatic and reached a crescendo with his final sentence: &#x201c;Glory to our wise leader and commander&#x2014;Marshal of the Soviet Union, the Great Stalin!&#x201d; At that moment artillery fired a salute and the orchestra struck up the Soviet national anthem.<br><br>After his speech Zhukov reviewed the parade standing beside Stalin. Partway through there was a pause in the march while, to a roll of drumbeats, 200 captured Nazi banners were piled against the Kremlin wall, much like Marshal Kutuzov&#x2019;s soldiers had thrown French standards at the feet of Tsar Alexander I after their defeat of Napoleon in 1812. The parade over, the day ended with a fabulous fireworks display.<br><br>Stalin&#x2019;s choice of Zhukov to lead the parade evoked no comment. He was, after all, Stalin&#x2019;s deputy supreme commander and widely regarded as the main architect of the Soviet victory over Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany, a victory that had saved Europe as well as Russia from Nazi enslavement. Newsreel film of the parade that flashed across the world only reinforced Zhukov&#x2019;s status as the greatest Soviet general of the Second World War.<br><br>When the German armies invaded Soviet Russia in summer 1941 it was Zhukov who led the Red Army&#x2019;s first successful counteroffensive, forcing the Wehrmacht to retreat and demonstrating to the whole world that Hitler&#x2019;s war machine was not invincible. When Leningrad was surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 Stalin sent Zhukov to save the city from imminent capture. A month later, Stalin recalled Zhukov to Moscow and put him in command of the defense of the Soviet capital. Not only did Zhukov stop the German advance on Moscow, but in December 1941 he launched a counteroffensive that drove the Wehrmacht away from the city and ended Hitler&#x2019;s hope of subduing the Red Army and conquering Russia in a single Blitzkrieg campaign.<br><br>Six months later Hitler tried again to inflict a crippling blow on the Red Army, this time by launching a southern offensive designed to capture the Soviet oilfields at Baku. At the height of the German advance south Zhukov played a central role in masterminding the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad in November 1942&#x2014;an encirclement operation that trapped 300,000 German troops in the city. In July 1943 he followed that dazzling success with a stunning victory in the great armored clash at Kursk&#x2014;a battle that saw the destruction of the last remaining reserves of Germany&#x2019;s panzer power. In November 1943 cheering crowds welcomed Zhukov as he and the future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev drove into the recaptured Ukrainian capital of Kiev. In June 1944 Zhukov coordinated Operation Bagration&#x2014;the campaign to liberate Belorussia from German occupation. Bagration brought the Red Army to the gates of Warsaw and the capture of the Polish capital in January 1945 and marked the beginning of the Vistula-Oder operation&#x2014;an offensive that took Zhukov&#x2019;s armies through Poland, into eastern Germany, and to within striking distance of Berlin. In April 1945 Zhukov led the final Soviet assault on Berlin. The ferocious battle for the German capital cost the lives of 80,000 Soviet soldiers but by the end of April Hitler was dead and the Soviet flag flew over the ruins of the Reichstag. It was Zhukov who formally accepted Germany&#x2019;s unconditional surrender on May 9, 1945.<br><br>Following Zhukov&#x2019;s triumphant parade before the assembled legions of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force in June 1945 he seemed destined for an equally glorious postwar career as the Soviet Union&#x2019;s top soldier and in March 1946 he was appointed commander-in-chief of all Soviet ground forces. However, within three months Zhukov had been sacked by Stalin and banished to the command of the Odessa Military District.<br><br>The ostensible reason for Zhukov&#x2019;s dismissal was that he had been disloyal and disrespectful toward Stalin and claimed too much personal credit for victory in the Great Patriotic War, as the Soviets called it. In truth, Zhukov&#x2019;s loyalty to Stalin was beyond question. If anyone deserved the appellation &#x201c;Stalin&#x2019;s General,&#x201d; he did. Zhukov was not slow to blow his own trumpet, at least in private, but that was characteristic of top generals the world over, including many of his colleagues in the Soviet High Command&#x2014;who all voted in favor of Stalin&#x2019;s resolution removing him as commander-in-chief. What Stalin really objected to was Zhukov&#x2019;s independent streak and his tendency to tell the truth as he saw it, a quality that had served the dictator well during the war but was less commendable in peacetime when Stalin felt he needed no advice except his own. Like Zhukov, Stalin could be vain, and he was jealous of the attention lavished on his deputy during and immediately after the war, even though he had been instrumental in the creation of Zhukov&#x2019;s reputation as a great general. Stalin&#x2019;s treatment of Zhukov also sent a message to his other generals: if Zhukov, the most famous among them and the closest to Stalin, could suffer such a fate, so could any one of them if they did not behave themselves.<br><br>According to his daughter Era, Zhukov was not a man given to overt displays of emotion, even in the privacy of his family, but his demotion and exile to Odessa caused him great distress. Later, he told the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov: &#x201c;I was firmly resolved to remain myself. I understood that they were waiting for me to give up and expecting that I would not last a day as a district commander. I could not permit this to happen. Of course, fame is fame. At the same time it is a double-edged sword and sometimes cuts against you. After this blow I did everything to remain as I had been. In this I saw my inner salvation.&#x201d;<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s troubles were only just beginning, however. In February 1947 he was expelled from the Communist Party Central Committee on grounds that he had an &#x201c;antiparty attitude.&#x201d; Zhukov was horrified and he pleaded with Stalin for a private meeting with the dictator to clear his name. Stalin ignored him and the anti-Zhukov campaign continued. In June 1947 Zhukov was censured for giving the singer Lidiya Ruslanova a military medal when she had visited Berlin in August 1945. Shortly after, Ruslanova and her husband, General V. V. Krukov, were arrested and imprisoned. &#x201c;In 1947 I feared arrest every day,&#x201d; recalled Zhukov later, &#x201c;and I had a bag ready with my underwear in it.&#x201d;<br><br>The next development was even more ominous: an investigation began into the war booty Zhukov had extracted while serving in Germany. According to the report of a party commission Zhukov amassed a personal hoard of trophies, including 70 pieces of gold jewelry, 740 items of silverware, 50 rugs, 60 pictures, 3,700 meters of silk, and&#x2014;presumably after casting a professional eye over them&#x2014;320 furs (he had been a furrier in his youth). Zhukov pleaded that these were gifts or paid from his own pocket but the commission found his explanations insincere and evasive and concluded that while he did not deserve to be expelled from the party he should hand over his ill-gotten loot to the state. In January 1948 Zhukov was demoted to the command of the Urals Military District based in Sverdlovsk.<br><br>Further punishment came in the form of treating Zhukov as an &#x201c;unperson.&#x201d; He was written out of the history of the Great Patriotic War. Paintings of the 1945 Victory Parade omitted him. A 1948 documentary film about the battle of Moscow barely featured Zhukov. In a 1949 poster tableau depicting Stalin and his top generals plotting and planning the great counteroffensive at Stalingrad Zhukov was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>But as early as October 1949 there were signs of Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation. That month Pravda carried a funeral notice of the death of Marshal F. I. Tolbukhin and Zhukov was listed among the signatories. In 1950 Zhukov, along with a number of other senior officers, was reelected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1952 the second edition of the official Great Soviet Encyclopedia carried a short but favorable entry on Zhukov, stressing his important role in the realization of Stalin&#x2019;s military plans during the war. In October 1952 Zhukov was a delegate to the 19th Party Congress and he was restored to candidate (i.e., probationary) membership of the Central Committee. Incredibly, Zhukov believed that Stalin was preparing to appoint him minister of defense.<br><br>In March 1953 Stalin died and Zhukov was a prominent member of the military guard of honor at the dictator&#x2019;s state funeral. Zhukov&#x2019;s appointment as deputy minister of defense was among the first announcements made by the new, post-Stalin Soviet government. Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation continued apace with his appointment in February 1955 as minister of defense by Khrushchev, Stalin&#x2019;s successor as party leader. In July 1955 Zhukov attended the great power summit in Geneva of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States&#x2014;the first such gathering since the end of the war. There he met and conversed with President Dwight Eisenhower, with whom he had served in Berlin just after the war. &#x201c;Could the friendship of two old soldiers,&#x201d; wondered Time magazine, &#x201c;provide the basis for a genuine easing of tensions between the U.S. and Russia?&#x201d;<br><br>As minister of defense, Zhukov emerged as a prominent public figure in the Soviet Union, second only in importance to Khrushchev. In June 1957 Zhukov played a pivotal role in resisting an attempt to oust Khrushchev from the leadership by a hard-line faction led by Vyacheslav Molotov, the former foreign minister. Unfortunately for Zhukov his bravura performance in the struggle against Molotov turned him into a political threat in Khrushchev&#x2019;s eyes. In October 1957 Zhukov was accused of plotting to undermine the role of the Communist Party in the armed forces. Among Zhukov&#x2019;s most active accusers were many of the same generals and marshals he had served with during the war. Khrushchev sacked Zhukov as minister of defense and in March 1958 he was retired from the armed forces at the relatively young age of sixty-one.<br><br>During the remainder of the Khrushchev era Zhukov suffered the same fate of excision from the history books he had experienced during his years of exile under Stalin. In 1960, for example, the party began to publish a massive multivolume history of the Great Patriotic War that barely mentioned Zhukov while greatly exaggerating Khrushchev&#x2019;s role. Another expression of Zhukov&#x2019;s disgrace was his isolation from the outside world. When American author Cornelius Ryan visited the USSR in 1963 to research his book on the battle of Berlin, Zhukov was the only Soviet marshal he was prohibited from seeing.<br><br>Zhukov took solace in writing his memoirs. His authorial role model was Winston Churchill, whose memoir-history of the Second World War he had read when a restricted-circulation Russian translation was published in the USSR in the 1950s. Churchill&#x2019;s motto in composing that work was that history would bear him out&#x2014;because he was going to write the history! Zhukov seems to have harbored similar sentiments and his memoirs were designed not only to present his own point of view but to answer and refute his Khrushchevite critics, even if that meant skewing the historical record in his own favor.<br><br>While Khrushchev continued to rule the Soviet Union there was no chance Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs would be published. When his daughter Ella asked him why he bothered he said he was writing for the desk drawer. In October 1964, however, Khrushchev was ousted from power and there began a process of rehabilitating Zhukov as a significant military figure. Most notably, the Soviet press began to publish Zhukov&#x2019;s articles again, including his accounts of the battles of Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin.<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s second rehabilitation rekindled interest in him in the West, which had faded somewhat after he was ousted as defense minister. In 1969 the American journalist and historian Harrison E. Salisbury published an unauthorized translation of Zhukov&#x2019;s articles in a book called Marshal Zhukov&#x2019;s Greatest Battles. In his introduction to the volume Salisbury famously described Zhukov as &#x201c;the master of the art of mass warfare in the 20th century.&#x201d; Most reviewers agreed. John Erickson, the foremost British authority on the Red Army, writing in The Sunday Times, said &#x201c;the greatest soldier so far produced by the 20th century is Marshal Georgi Zhukov of the Soviet Union. On the very simplest reckoning he is the general who never lost a battle. . . . For long enough the German generals have had their say, extolling their own skills . . . now it is the turn of Marshal Zhukov, a belated appearance to be sure but the final word may be his.&#x201d;<br><br>When Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs were published in April 1969 it was in a handsome edition with colored maps and hundreds of photographs, including some from Zhukov&#x2019;s personal archive. The Soviet public was wildly enthusiastic about the memoirs. The initial print run of 300,000 soon sold out and millions more sales followed, including hundreds of thousands in numerous translations. The memoirs quickly became&#x2014;and remain&#x2014;the single most influential personal account of the Great Patriotic War.</p><h2>Comrade Charlie</h2><p>Demoted to a low-grade clerk for his abrasive personality, Charlie Muffin stumbles onto a British traitor entangled in a high-stakes KGB intelligence-gathering mission.</p><p><p>Brian Freemantle [b. 1936] is one of Britain's most acclaimed authors of spy fiction. His novels have sold over ten million copies worldwide. Born in Southampton, Freemantle entered his career as a journalist, and began writing espionage thrillers in the late 1960s. Charlie M (1977) introduced the world to Charlie Muffin and won Freemantle international recognition&#x2014;he would go on to publish fourteen titles in the series.&nbsp;<br><br>Freemantle has written dozens of other novels, including two featuring Sebastian Holmes, an illegitimate son of Sherlock Holmes, and the Cowley and Danilov series, about an American FBI agent and a Russian militia detective who work together to comabt organized crime in the post-Cold War world. Freemantle lives and works in London, England.</p>The incorrigible British agent Charlie Muffin is back, but no James Bond is he. It's the late 1980s, and the Soviet Union is beginning to crumble. Moscow, intending to beat the U.S. Star Wars program, schemes to gain vital intelligence. Muffin, whose been demoted by his British superiors, inadvertently walks into the thick of things. Hayward Morse has a pleasant voice; he's great when playing a cultured Briton and credible when performing several Russian characters. However, he's miscast as Charlie, who is as far from proper, as you can imagine. Still, Morse's reading and Freemantle's writing bring back memories.

In it, he claimed that to induce rapid weight loss one need only follow a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet--carbs were the culprit in keeping people overweight. Twenty years later, he published Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution , continuing to maintain that weight gain had little to do with fat intake--a controversial conviction. His latest work is a cookbook designed as a companion to the 1992 volume, and promising to provide the most "mouth-watering meals for the most effective diet ever devised." In case readers are unfamiliar with his weight-loss program, Atkins describes its four stages and offers a selection of sample menus. Recipes range from the simple (hard-boiled eggs) to appetizers, salads, meats and poultry. No-holds-barred desserts call for heavy cream, eggs, sour cream and butter; despite Atkins's claims, his is not always light cooking. In the end, it's the desserts that illustrate the absurdities of the Atkins program: a recipe for cheesecake is chock full of cream cheese, eggs and creme fraiche, yet the final ingredient is 12 packets of a sugar substitute. "Good cuisine has always rooted itself firmly in luxurious fat," writes Atkins in his introduction. Really? <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.This complement to Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution (LJ 7/92) presents menus along with 200 recipes. Devised by Atkins Center director Fran Gare, the recipes follow the same high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (including the complex carbohydrates) that Atkins proposes in his previous book. Atkins maintains that his diet controls diabetes, but the Atkins diet is contrary to information given by the American Dietetic Association and the American Diabetic Association. In the "University of California at Berkeley Wellness Letter" (December 1992), Dr. Sheldon Margen cautions people against following this diet, arguing that it could harm some people, especially diabetics. All cheeses are allowed freely (though they are high in fat, sodium, and cholesterol), as are all meats. Several recipes for salad dressings contain raw eggs, which could lead to salmonella food poisoning. Since the recipes in this book could be dangerous if followed, it is not recommended.<br><i>Loraine F.

It has puts all the events from the scriptures in chronological order so simple minds like mine can understand them ;) It's very well written with tons of scriptural references (which I like), and handy charts in the back that make it as simple as possible. It's a great book, I recommend it. --goodreads.com<br><br>Derek's review: ***** Five Stars I asked my Father in law, who by the way is in our local wards leadership, to take a look at it first and he took one day and said it is wonderful so far, a great book. He read about half already and told me it would be helpful to anyone wanting to know more about what we believe will come to take place during the second comming. Now I have plans to read the book but wanted to give what I believe is a more important review by letting him read it first as I go to him often with questions about scriptures. If he says it is great then it has my vote! By the way, he already knew who the writer is as he has read his writting before. --goodreads.com<br><br>Internet Review by kiwi, Sun Mar 12, 2006 An example of an outstanding last days book recently published is "The Second Coming of Jesus Christ" by Kevan Clawson.

Trolls. Sea Monsters. Rain of toads. Skyquakes. Sunnydale is being besieged by dark forces. But even with Buffy providing her unique style of damage control while Giles is hospitalized out of town, it&#39;s more than one Slayer can handle -- especially since the abominations are coming from a centuries-old portal through time and space. Somehow, the hell-hole must be found and corked at its source. For Buffy, Angel, and the rest of her gang, that means a road trip to Boston where an ailing Gatekeeper resides over a supernatural mansion that has been, until recently, holding the world&#39;s worst monsters at bay. Once there, Buffy discovers the catastrophic truth: the magical structurehouses thousands of rooms, all of which are doorways to limbo&#39;s &#34;ghost roads,&#34; and all of which may bring her face-to-face with the most nefarious forces in hell and on earth -- forces bent on horrific plans far worse than the Slayer ever imagined.</p><p><b>Christopher Golden</b> is the best-selling author of the epic dark fantasy series <i>The Shadow Saga,</i> as well as the X-Men trilogy <i>Mutant Empire</i> and the current hardcover <i>Codename Wolverine.</i> With Nancy Holder, he has written several other Buffy projects, including the <i>Gatekeeper Trilogy</i> and <i>The Watcher's Guide.</i> He is currently at work on a series of YA mystery novels for Pocket Books. Please visit him at www.christophergolden.com.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Bodies gyrated, music pounded through pitiful speakers, drinks were poured, imbibed, or spilled in mass quantities. A watered-down gin and tonic in hand, Rupert Giles stood in the far corner of the room and took it all in, careful not to show his disdain. That would be unforgivably rude. This might be New York City, the capital city of rudeness, but that did not mean Giles had to behave in a boorish manner. Come to think of it, there were plenty of boors in London. </p><p> Surprised as he was by it, he was forced to admit, at least to himself, that he missed Southern California. At least a little bit. Certainly he missed Buffy and the other students with whom he spent so much time. But there was a certain comfort to the West Coast's laissez-faire attitude that he had begun to enjoy...and which, despite the bacchanalia surrounding him, the East Coast distinctly lacked. </p><p> In truth, great forces had conspired to bring him to Manhattan in late winter. Not the least of which was pressure from his employer, the principal of Sunnydale High School, to at least make an effort to become better versed in modern library science. It seemed the Dewey decimal system just wasn't good enough for some people anymore. In some ways, books weren't even the answer. It was all about information now, he thought sadly. And much of that information, however incomplete, however orphaned from any pedigree, was drawn from computers these days. </p><p> His only previous interest in computers had been generated by Jenny Calendar, the woman he'd loved. And that meager interest had died and been buried along with her. </p><p> The other primary reason that Giles agreed to attend this function -- "Libraries 2000," sponsored by the American Library Association, among others -- was the fact that many of the events were to be held in the Warwick Hotel, a grand old dame of a building whose granite and gargoyles looked down on 57th Street with all the haughtiness of Britain's proudest structures. He had stayed at the Warwick on one of his first visits to the United States, and recalled with pleasure an enormous mural of Queen Elizabeth knighting Sir Francis Drake in the downstairs dining room. </p><p> Indeed, in spite of his misgivings, Giles had managed to enjoy himself for the past few days, both with the other librarians he'd met and exploring New York alone. It was an extraordinary city. It was true, he'd discovered (or at least, hypothesized), that one could find literally anything in this city, if one knew where to look. The seminar had, thus far, been a relaxing escape from Sunnydale and from the pressures of his role as the Watcher. </p><p> He felt a bit guilty for having abandoned Buffy, even for a week, but she had nearly forced him to go, even instructed him on what to pack. He had disappointed her, he was sure, in his refusal to "go more cazh" and "leave all that tweedy stuff in the library, where it belongs." She also arranged for Cordelia to drive him to the airport, a trip he hoped never to repeat, given her penchant for checking her makeup in the rearview mirror. She had even supplied him with an ancient, weather-worn copy of New York on Five Dollars a Day, thoughtfully marking sights she imagined he might enjoy, and which, frankly, he had: the museums and a number of bookshops. It seemed fairly clear that Buffy had actually wanted him to go. Who could blame her? He was, at least officially, an authority figure in her life. It would be nice for her to be free of him for a time. Still, Giles looked forward to returning home, and suspected that Buffy would be pleased when he did return. And, thus far, there seemed to have been no urgent aim requiring his attention at home. </p><p> Reluctant as he was to admit it, Giles was having...well, fun. </p><p> At least, he had been until he'd entered <i>this</i> room. The invitation, a splashy foldout from something called stacks.com, which was apparently an Internet meeting place for librarians, had announced a cocktail reception in the Cary Grant Suite of the Warwick Hotel. Well, seeing the Cary Grant Suite had proven to be an irresistable lure for Giles, and it was, indeed, something to see. </p><p> There was a large bedroom on either side of the enormous parlor that served as a reception room. The suite was at the southwest corner of the hotel, and there were two sets of French doors that opened out onto an absolutely extraordinary balcony. It wasn't at all like any balcony Giles had ever seen, and certainly not something twenty-seven stories above the city. The enormous stone edifice was more like a large terrace one might see at a stately home in the Cotswolds. At least twenty-five feet wide, it ran the length of the Cary Grant Suite's outer wall. The granite color matched the sky; it was apparently quite chilly outside, and the forecast had called for snow, but so far none had fallen. </p><p> Giles wondered if he ought to escape to the balcony, despite the cold. It would be a welcome relief from the party. As a rule, the librarians who were attending the stacks.com "cocktail reception" were younger than he, and American. The men wore blue jeans and sneakers with their button-down shirts, and the women, perhaps eager for a chance to dress, wore tiny black dresses or silk pants. </p><p> With his gabardine suit and old-school burgundy tie, Giles knew how out of place he must have appeared. Even that was only a fraction of how out of place he actually felt. He brushed a hand through his slightly graying brown hair , then pushed his glasses up his nose for the hundredth time. </p><p> "Good Lord," he muttered to himself. "These are librarians?" </p><p> But if he were honest with himself, Giles would be forced to admit that it wasn't the dress or behavior of these people that had him wanting so desperately to retreat. Nor was it the fact that, with his love of dusty old books and getting lost in the stacks -- ironically, the place he felt the most at home, and the polar opposite of the stacks.com party -- he felt positively antique, though even the youngest person in the room was little more than a decade his junior. </p><p> No. Worst of all was how much they all reminded him of Jenny. With their sense of fashion and their technical knowledge and the confidence with which they spoke, moved, danced, even breathed, the people crowding the Cary Grant Suite gave him great cause for lament. </p><p> It wasn't exactly grief, or mourning. Enough time had passed that those wounds had begun to heal. He'd even caught his eyes roaming appreciatively from time to time. The thought had occurred to him that he might, at some point, meet someone else whom he would like to have in his life. Someone else to love. </p><p> But he still missed her terribly. Still ached to tell her little things that he'd discovered in his research and wanted to share, only to realize that he had no one one to share them with. No one who could truly appreciate what such utter trivialities meant to him. It still hurt. </p><p> With a sigh, Giles edged around several people who were talking loudly together about a "chat room" where they'd apparently spoken with Frank Herbert, the author of <i>Dune.</i> Giles didn't have the heart to tell them that Herbert had been dead for years, and was dismayed that they didn't realize it themselves. Dismayed but not particularly surprised. After all, it all boiled down to Web sites and URL's not frontispieces and back matter. A pity. </p><p> He opened one of the French doors and let himself onto the stone balcony, where a large group of people had already gathered. The sharp wind brought the scent of smoke. Instantly, Giles understood the hardiness of his fellows. Most of them were smokers, exiled to the frozen outdoors by law and the demands of political correctness. </p><p> With a shiver, he turned up the collar of his suit coat, and shoved his hands deep in the pockets of his gabardine trousers. In his room, he had a very nice pair of leather gloves, which he wished he'd brought. Exhaling, seeing his breath curl as if he, too, had lit a cigarette, his eyes scanned the cityscape, the lights and the activity far below. Sixth Avenue was bright with the electricity of life, vivid with every bit of excitement and bluster and spectacle that humanity could muster. That was New York City to him. </p><p> "Breathtaking, isn't it?" </p><p> Her voice was soft, her tone thoughtful, with none of the razor edge of the city in it. Giles blinked, glanced just to his left, uncertain at first if the woman was speaking to him. But he couldn't see her in his peripheral vision. Giles turned, and for a moment, he couldn't breathe. </p><p> She was divine. A tall, yet lithe woman with the most delicate features imaginable. Her faced seemed to glow, and though it might have been the neon burning in the city beyond, Giles chose to deem it some ethereal light. In either case, it made her look almost angelic. A splash of her honey-blond hair fell in a gentle wave across her face, while the rest was done up in a long, elaborate braid that fell down past her shoulders. It was unfashionably long, but Giles thought it quite lovely. </p><p> She wore a crushed red velvet dress with tight sleeves that accentuated the golden color of her hair. It wasn't the most daring dress he had ever seen, but the way it fell across her body, few women could have worn it well. She wore it very, very well. </p><p> The Watcher realized that he was staring. </p><p> "I'm...I'm sorry," he stammered. "Did, uh, did you say something?" </p><p> The woman smiled at him, and Giles felt himself offering a silly, lopsided grin in return. </p><p> "You seemed to be appreciating the city," she said. "I merely commented that it was breathtaking." </p><p> American, he presumed, because of her lack of accent. But an American who used the word <i>merely</i> in casual conversation! Giles felt himself falling rapidly into infatuation. </p><p> "Indeed it is," he said, after what felt like an embarrassingly long pause. "For such a depraved city, it certainly has its charms." </p><p> The woman smiled broadly, and laughed softly, comfortably. There was a sort of gentle lilt to her laughter that gave it the ring of authenticity. She meant it. </p><p> "There is always a certain charm in depravity," she said boldly, grinning at Giles. </p><p> As his cheeks flushed crimson, she turned her gaze away from him and out toward the city he had been admiring moments ago. "It is a wonderful place," she said. "Though I suspect most of the tech-head numbskulls slobbering all over each other in the other room have rarely if ever even looked out a window." </p><p> Giles chuckled, dropped his gaze, then brought his hand up quickly to keep his glasses from plummeting twenty-seven stories. He gave her a sidelong glance and thought, whimsically, <i>It could be love.</i> </p><p> "Rupert Giles," he said, turning to hold out his hand. </p><p> With a firm grip, she shook it. "Micaela Tomasi," she said. "It's very much my pleasure." </p><p> "You must be cold." </p><p> She raised her face and nodded. "I am." </p><p> He gave her his suit jacket, and felt warmer than he had since landing at JFK. </p><p> That was the beginning. For nearly an hour, they spoke of New York, its culture and museums, its depravity, and then of other cities they'd visited or yearned to visit. They talked of books and bookstores, and Giles was astonished to find that she was aware of some of his favorite used bookstores, some so out of the way he'd nearly forgotten about them himself. From Avenue Victor Hugo in Boston, to Cobwebs on Great Russell Road, across from the British Museum in London, Micaela knew them all. </p><p> The party ended, the other librarians leaving very reluctantly. The bartenders in their white shirts and black vests left their posts. A man came with a noisy industrial vacuum cleaner, whose hum could be heard through the closed balcony doors. </p><p> Still, Giles and Micaela talked on. There seemed to be so much to say. A few minutes before midnight, Giles looked regretfully at his watch. </p><p> "I hate to bring this up, but..." </p><p> "Yes," she immediately agreed. "It is getting late. Perhaps we could pick up our conversation at breakfast?" </p><p> The Watcher nearly laughed out loud. In his experience, there was nothing like avoiding the discomfort of asking a woman out by having her ask first. </p><p> "I can't think of anything I'd rather do," he said with great certainty. "Shall we say nine o'clock, in the lobby?" </p><p> "I'll be there, stomach rumbling," she replied. </p><p> They walked together out to the elevator. When they had stepped in, and he had pressed the number 16, she chuckled to herself. </p><p> "Hmm?" he asked. "Did I miss something?" </p><p> "We're on the same floor," she said. "I was just thinking what a lark it would have been if they'd double-booked me into your room." </p><p> Giles blinked, blushed once more, but his only reply was a slightly embarrassed smile. His mind, however, was racing with the possibilities. So much so, that when they stepped off on the sixteenth floor, and Micaela turned in the opposite direction, he felt a bit of disappointment. </p><p> "Good night, Miss Tomasi," Giles said. "Sleep well." </p><p> "And to you, Mr. Giles," she replied, almost primly. Then mischief crept into her eyes as she said, "Pleasant dreams." </p><p> As he walked down the hall toward his room, Giles whistled jauntily, his jaw muscles already somewhat sore from the smile that threatened to stretch his face for eternity. Somewhere, he heard a phone begin to ring. Around the corner, he heard a door open. He reached the juncture in the corridor, rounded the corner, and was nearly barreled over by a broad-shouldered man wearing a Yankees baseball cap. </p><p> "'Scuse," the man grunted, but didn't look up; his face was obscured by the bill of the cap. </p><p> "Yes, well," Giles said, affronted. "Perhaps if you watched where you were walking..." </p><p> But his reproach was lost on the man, who had hurried around the corner. Grumbling Giles turned back down the corridor. Only then did he notice that the phone was still ringing. The sound was coming from the open door of room 1622, just down the hall. </p><p> His room. </p><p> The phone stopped ringing as Giles rushed to the open door, eyes darting about with caution. He pushed the door fully open and flicked on the light. The place was a shambles. Many of his things were in tatters, the clothes thrown about the room, drawers open, mirror shattered. A thief, he realized immediately. Searching for valuables. And the phone ringing? A signal, perhaps, from a cohort, lying in wait to warn the burglar should the room's registered occupant return. </p><p> It had just happened. The phone, the sound of a door opening. </p><p> The man in the Yankees cap. </p><p> Giles ran from his room, sprinted along the corridor and around the corner. Down the hall, he saw the stairwell door swinging shut under the glowing red EXIT sign. The anger that began to build inside him was a distant memory, but all too familiar. There existed within Rupert Giles a man capable of great bouts of rage. It didn't matter if the thief had actually stolen anything, for Giles had little of value with him save for a few antique books. </p><p> No, it was the principle of the thing. The violation. </p><p> The anger boiled up inside him and his heart pou...</p></p><h2>Seekers: Return to the Wild #5: The Burning Horizon</h2><p><p><strong>Erin Hunter's <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Seekers series continues in the fifth book in the Return to the Wild story arc.

A man is possessed by the spirit of an eighteenth-century noblewoman every time he plays chess; a crippled boy yearns for brotherhood; dreaming and spinning lies to one another, a group of old men wait for death. No one but Barry Hannah could create this vivid world - and explore the nature of lust, captivity, and love in marriage.<br>Barry Hannah's reputation as a master of the short story, first established in 1978 with the publication of Airships, is magnified in this volatile, long-awaited collection of new stories. Astonishing in range and in portrayal of the human heart, these fierce and radar-perfect stories give us individuals in whom hilarity and pain combine with true and startling clarity.</p><p>In his long-anticipated but disappointing second volume of short stories, one of the gurus of contemporary "guy" fiction ( Airships ; Boomerang ) focuses on the red-blooded American subjects with which he has made his reputation--sex, booze, drugs and guns. The visceral description for which Hannah has rightly been praised in the past degenerates here into bad-taste verbosity and sophomoric prurience. "High-Water Railers" concerns fishing and old men, one named Sidney Farte, as they share sexual secrets and confessions of missed opportunity. "Scandale d'Estime" begins with great promise in Kosciusko, Miss. (Hannah's home state), as old reprobate Harold befriends teenage George and takes him to a production of Waiting for Godot ; the story line (which also includes the young man's infatuation with an older woman) disintegrates into short takes on paregoric addiction, attempted suicide, the Klan, and bondage equipment. The best story, "The Spy of Loog Root," pairs the telescope-toting scion of a white-trash clan with the owner of a tobacco and magazine shop in Montana, and shows what Hannah is capable of in terms of characterization and emotional insight. For the most part, though, he seems to have invested more time in pompous, overwritten story titles--"Upstairs, Mona Bayed for Dong," "Hey, Have You got a Cig, the Time, the News, My Face?"--than in polishing the pieces themselves (some of which consist of only a few paragraphs). Half of these 23 stories have been published in magazines; a few aren't ready to be published anywhere. Too much of this volume reads like the output of a writing group that meets in a bar; as the saying goes, "You had to be there." Author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hannah's approach to writing is wonderfully summed up by a character named Harold in the story "Scandale d'Estime." "Scandal is delicious, little man. All we are is obsession and pain. That is all humans are. And when these things go public and are met with howls, they ring out the only honest history we have. They are unbearable! Magnificent! Wicked!" Indeed, there is a fierceness to these 23 pieces (to call them all stories is something of a misnomer) that generates both power and perturbation. In his drive to get to the essence of things, Hannah takes no prisoners. Some readers will find his work misogynistic and offensive in its violence, yet beneath its often tormented surface lies a desperate, almost tender search for truth. Coming out of the Southern tradition, Hannah writes with fervor and, in spite of the violence, considerable humor. He is willing to take chances, to go to the edge, to challenge the reader in untypical ways. Not a "mainstream" work, this book nonetheless belongs in most library collections.

It's all here: Never-before-published excerpts from <i>Hitchhiker </i>radio scripts. Douglas Adams' early work with <i>Monty Python, Dr. Who,</i> and <i>Snow Seven and the White Dwarfs</i> The real-life models for Marvin the Paranoid Android, Ford Prefect, and Zaphod Beeblebrox The real reason that Arthur Dent wears a bathrobe, and more! So grab a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, settle back and... DON'T PANIC!Definitely a devotee's book, Don't Panic operates on several levels at once. The book pokes hilarious fun at the tell-all books by cult heroes as well as at the industry that inevitably grows up around phenomenal successes like Douglas Adams's bizarre, witty radio series and ensuing novels. This work is also a spoof of the Hitchhiker books and particularly of the idiosyncratic, teasing style that has made Adams's novels bestsellers in England and the U.S. A London-based freelance journalist and avid Adams fan, Gaiman interviews his hero, revealing the full story of how Hitchhiker came to be, grew and flourished. Readers learn of the misunderstanding between Adams and John Lloyd, the radio producer who almost became Adams's collaborator on the novelization of Hitchhiker. But far more engrossing than the gossip are the sheer mechanics of moving the odd characters populating the world of Hitchhiker from radio drama to the printed page to television. For those who have followed Adams's work with relish, this will be a source of much delightful trivia; non-initiates, however, are quite likely to panic if they enter this book unprepared. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Outrage: An Inspector Erlendur Novel (An Inspector Erlendur Series)</h2><p><p>"Indridason fills the void that remains after you've read Stieg Larsson's novels." &#x2015;<i>USA Today</i></p><p>Arnaldur Indridason has proven himself to be a master of the mystery genre with his critically acclaimed Inspector Erlunder series, which has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.

He didn't want to set off too early - someone might notice him hanging around in a half-empty bar and he wanted to avoid that. The most import ant thing was to melt into the crowd, to go unnoticed, to be like everyone else. He mustn't be memorable in any way, must not stand out. In the unlikely event that anyone asked him about his movements that evening, he would say he had been at home all night, watching TV. If everything went according to plan, no one, anywhere, would remember his presence.</p><p>When the time was right he drained his glass and left. He was slightly tipsy. He walked from his home near the city centre through the autumn darkness towards the bar. The town was already buzzing with weekend revellers. Queues were forming at the most popular venues, bouncers were flexing their muscles and people were wheedling for admission. Music could be heard in the street, and food smells from restaurants mingled with the alcoholic fumes seeping from the bars. Some people were drunker than others. He despised them.</p><p>He had only a short wait before he made it inside. It wasn't one of the most fashionable places, but it was crammed all the same. That was fine. He had already been on the lookout for girls or young women on his way through town: preferably not much over thirty, preferably not stone-cold sober. It was all right if they'd had a bit to drink but he didn't want them too drunk.</p><p>He kept a low profile. He patted his jacket pocket once more, to be sure he had it. He had touched the pocket lightly several times on the way, knowing that he must be one of those neurotic types who were forever checking whether they'd locked the door, forgotten their keys, whether the coffee maker was definitely switched off or a hotplate had been left on. He was obsessive like that - he recalled reading about it in some magazine. Another article had been about a different compulsion of his: washing his hands twenty times a day.</p><p>Most people were drinking half-litres of beer, so he ordered the same. The bartender hardly glanced at him, and he took care to pay cash. He found it easy to blend in. Most of the customers were about his age, out with friends or colleagues. The drinkers raised their voices to be heard over the heavy rap beat of the music and the din was deafening. He took a leisurely look around, observing groups of women sitting and standing together. Other women were with boyfriends or husbands, but there was no one who appeared to be alone. He left without finishing his drink.</p><p>At the third place he spotted a woman he recognised - he thought she was probably about thirty and she seemed to be on her own. She sat at a table in the smoking area, surrounded by other smokers, but she was clearly not with them. He observed her from a distance as she sipped a margarita and smoked two cigarettes. The bar was packed, but no one who approached her seemed to know her.</p><p>Two men spoke to her but she shook her head and they left. A third man loomed over her, apparently unwilling to take no for an answer.</p><p>She was a brunette with a pretty face, a bit heavyset but nicely dressed in a skirt and a short-sleeved T-shirt and with a beautiful shawl around her shoulders. Across the T-shirt the words San Francisco were stencilled, with a little flower growing up out of the letter F.</p><p>She managed to shake off her persistent suitor, who made an angry remark and left.</p><p>He gave her time to settle down before he approached her. 'Have you been there?' he asked. The brunette looked up. She couldn't place him.</p><p>'To San Francisco?' he added, pointing at the shirt.</p><p>She looked down at her breasts.</p><p>'Oh, this?' she asked.</p><p>'It's a delightful city,' he said. 'You should go sometime.'</p><p>She looked at him, debating whether to tell him to push off like she'd told the others. Then she seemed to remember meeting him before.</p><p>'There's so much going on there,' he said. 'In Frisco. A lot to see.'</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>'Fancy meeting you here,' she said.</p><p>'Yes, nice to see you. Are you here alone?'</p><p>'Alone? Yes.'</p><p>'So, what about Frisco? You must go.'</p><p>'I know, I've...'</p><p>Her words were drowned out by the noise. He passed his hand over his jacket pocket and leaned over her.</p><p>'The airfare's not cheap,' he said. 'But I mean...I went there once, it was great. A delightful city.'</p><p>He used certain words deliberately. She was looking up at him, and he imagined her counting on the fingers of one hand how many young men she had met in her life who would use a word like delightful.</p><p>'I know. I've been.'</p><p>'Oh. Well, then. May I join you?'</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, then moved over to make room for him.</p><p>Nobody took any notice of them in the bar, nor when they left a little over an hour later and headed back to his place, taking deserted side streets. By then the drug was working. He had offered her another margarita, and as he'd returned from the bar with her third drink he'd slid his hand into his jacket pocket to palm the pill and slipped it into her glass. They were getting along fine, and he was sure she would give him no trouble.</p><p>The Criminal Investigation Department received the notification two days later. El�nborg was on duty and she called out the team. When she arrived at the scene traffic police had already closed off the road, in the Thingholt district, and the forensics officers were just pulling up. She saw a representative of the Regional Medical Officer get out of his car. At the start of a case only forensics team members were permitted to enter the flat, to carry out their investigations. They 'froze' the scene, as they put it.</p><p>El�nborg made the necessary arrangements as she waited patiently for the forensics team to give her the go-ahead. Journalists and other media reporters were gathering, and she observed them at work. They were pushy - some were even rude to the police who were keeping them away from the crime scene. One or two of the TV reporters looked familiar: a vacuous quiz-show host who had recently transferred to the news, and the presenter of a political chat show. She had no idea why he should be down here with the news teams. El�nborg recalled her early days with the CID, when she'd been one of only a handful of women detectives: back then the reporters had been much more polite, and far fewer. She preferred the press journalists. Print-media people were less rushed, less overbearing and less self-important than the TV reporters toting their video cameras. Some of them could even write.</p><p>Neighbours stood at their windows or had stepped out into their doorways, arms crossed in the autumn chill, puzzlement on their faces; they had no idea what had happened. Police officers had started questioning them: had they noticed anything unusual on the street, or specifically at the house, anyone coming or going? Did they know the resident? Had they been inside?</p><p>El�nborg had once rented a flat in Thingholt, long before it had become fashionable. She had liked living in this historic area on the hillside above the old town centre. The houses, which varied in age, encapsulated a century of the history of building and architecture in the city: some had been humble labourers' cottages, others had been grand villas built by wealthy entrepreneurs. Rich and poor, masters and workers, had always lived there in harmony side by side until the district had started to attract young home-buyers with no interest in settling in the sprawling new suburbs that were stretching into the upland heaths, and who preferred to make their homes close to the heart of the city. The artistic and fashionable classes moved into the old timber-framed houses, and the splendid mansions were bought up by the super-wealthy and nouveau riche. They wore their downtown postcode like a badge of honour: 101 Reykjav�k.</p><p>The head of forensics appeared at the corner of the house and called to El�nborg. He reminded her to be careful, and not to touch anything.</p><p>'It's nasty,' he said.</p><p>'Oh?'</p><p>'Like an abattoir.'</p><p>The entrance to the ground-floor flat was at the rear, facing the garden, and was not visible from the road; a paved path led round to the back of the house. As she entered the flat El�nborg saw the body of a young man lying on the living-room floor. His trousers were around his ankles and he was wearing nothing but a blood-soaked T-shirt with the words San Francisco stencilled on it. A little flower was growing up out of the letter F.</p><p>OUTRAGE.

He studies queer theory, has a dyke best friend, makes zines, and is a fl�neur with a rich dating life. But Paul's also got a secret: he's a shapeshifter. Oscillating wildly from Riot Grrrl to leather cub, Women's Studies major to trade, Paul transforms his body at will in a series of adventures that take him from Iowa City to Boystown to Provincetown and finally to San Francisco--a journey through the deep queer archives of struggle and pleasure. <br> <br> Andrea Lawlor's debut novel offers a speculative history of early '90s identity politics during the heyday of ACT UP and Queer Nation. <i>Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl</i> is a riotous, razor-sharp bildungsroman whose hero/ine wends his way through a world gutted by loss, pulsing with music, and opening into an array of intimacy and connections.</p><p><br> "I love this book, in all its ecstasy, wit, and hilarity. I laughed out loud in recognition and appreciation of Lawlor's spot-on portraitof an era, scene, and soundtrack, the novel's particular sluice ofpleasures, fluids, and feelings. The liberatory rush of Lawlor's writing is as rare as it is contagious, not to mention HOT. Paul is on fire,and an antihero for the ages."<b> &#x2015;Maggie Nelson, author of <i>The Argonauts</i></b><br><br> "Fast-paced and cheeky, full of intellectual riffs, of observations so sharp they feel like gossip, <i>Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl</i> is a touchingly sweet-hearted and deeply cool book.

It's a tight satisfying masterpiece which I am <i>very</i> glad to hand you if you <i>happen</i> to love sex, clothes, literature which now includes the apparitional blessing of a new elastic genre (which <i>Paul</i> initiates) that seamlessly makes both what's <i>out there</i> and <i>in here</i> less lonely, less fixed and less fake.

Galeano also highlights individuals such as Pedro Fernandes Sardinha, the first bishop of Brazil, who was eaten by Caete Indians off the coast of Alagoas, as well as Abdul Kassem Ismael, the grand vizier of Persia, who kept books safe from war by creating a walking library of 117,000 tomes aboard four hundred camels, forming a mile-long caravan.<br>Beautifully translated by Galeano's longtime collaborator, Mark Fried, <i>Children of the Days</i> is a majestic humanist treasure that shows us how to live and how to remember. It awakens the best in us.</p><p><b>Eduardo Galeano</b> (1940-2015) was one of Latin America's most distinguished writers. A Uruguayan journalist, writer and novelist, he was considered, among other things, "a literary giant of the Latin American left" and "global soccer's pre-eminent man of letters." He is the author of the three-volume <i>Memory of Fire; Open Veins of Latin America;</i> <i>Soccer in Sun and Shadow</i>; <i>The Book of Embraces</i>; <i>Walking Words</i>; <i>Upside Down</i>; and <i>Voices in Time</i>. Born in Montevideo in 1940, he lived in exile in Argentina and Spain for years before returning to Uruguay. His work has been translated into twenty-eight languages. He is recipient of many international prizes, including the first Lannan Prize for Cultural Freedom, the Casa de las Americas Prize, and the First Distinguished Citizen of the region by the countries of Mercosur. Galeano once described himself as "a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia." Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i> "a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.""Booklist," starred review<br>"Galeano performs the sort of extraordinary feats of compassion, artistry, and imagination achieved in fiction by his fellow visionary Latin American writers, especially Borges, Garcia Marquez, and Bolano." <br>Neil Gordon, "New York Times Book Review" "Galeano's prose is nearly lulling in its lyricism."

More than the mere act of commemoration alone, these vignettes illume the dark and disregarded corners of our collective past (and act, perhaps, as bulwark against repeating its myriad misdeeds).... Eduardo Galeano composes prose as resplendent as some of his subjects are sorrowful. With ever the eye for the neglected, distressed, oppressed, and maligned (spanning thousands of years), he creates beauty where once there was betrayal, and intrigue where ignorance once thrived. From the familiar to the obscure, Galeano masterfully recollects and rescues from amnesiac disregard those for whom history has never made room.... Galeano makes an offering of his art so that we may yet be reminded of the inherent brilliance, dignity, and wonder of a life consumed not by belligerence, fanaticism, and the shallow pursuit of wealth but one that is instead receptive to the voices of others and the world at large."<br>Powells.com <br>"Even when his subjects are familiar, Galeano's conclusions are always surprising...A modern book of days celebrating forgotten moments of our collective, multicultural past."<br>Shelf Awareness <br>"Galeano is as damning of humanity as he is hopeful for it, packing varied historical reflection into a calendar year. His condensed history is, like life, at once dark and fascinating, sad yet uplifting."<br>"The Guardian" (UK) <br>"Eduardo Galeano's "Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History" is another impressive work of cogent and creative insight from a prophet who opens our eyes to the world as it is and as it could be if more of us would fight for peace, justice, and human equality."<br>Spirituality &amp; Practice <br>"Galeano's genre is his own - a mixture of fiction, journalism and history that, as always, is conveyed in orderly fragments of various sizes and is best understood as an outgrowth of his first midteen self-expressions as a socialist cartoonist. If you think of every short individual Galeano piece in the mammoth collection of them that comprises his life's work as a kind of verbal cartoon - or a set of variations on a verbal cartoon - then you understand both the striking singularity of his work and its innovation...Galeano's fire is unquenched. He keeps giving it to us in abundance."<br>Buffalo News <br>"It's May, but this is a Christmas kind of a book: giftable, covetable, hefty, handsome, a veritable plum pudding of a thing, its lovely midnight-blue cover designed to look as though dotted with stars, or perhaps dusted with sugar, and slathered all over with generous custardy recommendations from both Philip Pullman and John Berger... Galeano chronicles events and anniversaries from the history of oppressed nations, adding the odd dash of fictional fun and philosophical musing... The effect is dizzying, like staring up close for a very long time at the walls of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia..."Children of the Days" is the ne plus ultra of the Galeano style and form, a triumph of his mosaic art - 365 sad and strange and shiny little fragments, placed adjacent to one another to form a vast and seemingly coherent whole...This is a book of days, not for every day but for any day."<br>The Guardian <br>"Compelling, enlightening, tragic, hopeful, and hypnotic book: history in poetic snapshots... There are great stories in the book, pain and injustice too. And there is hope."<br>"Chicago Tribune" <br>"I think there is a strength within Latin American literature that resists the gusting of that stale wind. Authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and poets like Pablo Neruda hide within their respective voices a kind of power that seems refreshingly untouched by that wind's sapping flow. Eduardo Galeano is one of these. Already a distinguished presence within Latin American literature, Galeano's "Children of the Days" speaks with that power that seems often so illusive in other spheres of literature. This is the power I speak of: the ability to unleash your words to reveal the innermost truth of yourself. His words carry a blunt sincerity reminiscent of Marquez's short stories - amusing, thoughtful, and scathingly critical, often all within the same sentence. With each page of "Children of the Days," Galeano reveals himself anew, and challenges us to do the same... "Children of the Days" is many things. It is a reminder, a chance for introspection, a forgotten history, a critique and a call to arms... All of the days in Galeano's Calendar are poetry in the finest sense. His words weave surprise into the ordinary, and dig truth from the rubble of those who would hide it. Even translated to English they retain a rough rhythm as the line breaks push singular ideas from the page... "Children of the Days" is best read in pieces, perhaps day by day, as a reminder that we are inheritors of history both grand and foul. The way that we choose to live our lives each day will determine which side of our history we will fall on. Eduardo Galeano's clear voice propels us to sincerity. If we were to listen, maybe we could stand against stale winds as well as he."<br>"The Englewood Review of Books" <br>"The amazing Galeano has done it again.

She also worked on a smaller scale in watercolor, pastels, and charcoal, experimenting with themes and ideas. Fifty-five of her drawings are illustrated in <i>O'Keeffe on Paper</i>, which accompanies an exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. The images work on several levels: viewing what at first seem brightly colored, jewel-like abstractions, with titles such as <i>Pond in the Woods</i> and <i>Portrait of Paul Strand</i>, we suddenly become aware of more complex, realistic forms. Witty and accessible, O'Keeffe's drawings remind us to recognize significance and beauty in our daily surroundings. The book's supporting essays are well written and useful. The first, which places O'Keeffe in the context of her teachers and colleagues, is an excellent survey of the early-20th-century American avant-garde; the second explores the evolution of O'Keeffe's ideas, developing her youthful question, "If one can only reproduce nature, and always with less beauty than the original, why paint at all?" The final essay is a detailed analysis of the materials she used. An extra dimension is given by photographs of O'Keeffe at work and some illuminating pictures by artists who influenced her. Reflecting a statement by the critic John Canaday quoted early in the book--"In a drawing artists give us at full strength, but with minimum elaboration, the essence of whatever they have to say"--the images in <i>O'Keeffe on Paper</i> are deceptively simple but very satisfying. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p><h2>Scott 2018 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue Volume 5: Countries of the World N-SAM (Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue Vol 5 Countries N-Sam) (Scott Standard Postage Catalogue)</h2><p>This is the 150th Anniversary Edition.

He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, and moved to San Francisco in the mid-1950s when he became involved in the emerging beat scene. During the 1960s, he became one of the most prominent and prolific writers of the counterculture. Out of this period came some of his most famous works, the best known of which are <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>; his collection of poetry, <i>The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</i>; and his collection of stories, <i>Revenge of the Lawn</i>.

From time to time, scholars from various disciplines have argued for the existence of a vastly old ``founder civilization.'' Among the most famous was Charles Hapgood, who based his theory of a lost seafaring civilization on his analysis of the famous 16th-century ``Piri Re'is'' maps of the Antarctic land mass. In this tradition, Oppenheimer blends evidence from geology, genetics, linguistics, archaeology, and anthropology to argue persuasively that such a civilization existed on a submerged land mass in Southeast Asia, which geologists call the Sunda shelf. Pointing to geological evidence for the submersion of the shelf by abrupt rises in the sea level about 8,000 years ago, Oppenheimer contends that the coastal cultures of Southeast Asia were drowned by a great flood, reflected in flood mythologies scattered from the ancient Middle East (such as the biblical story of Noah) to Australia and the Americas. According to the author, tantalizing archaeological evidence exists of settlements under a ``silt curtain'' left by the sea floods in drowned coastal regions from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, while linguistic markers indicate that languages spread from Southeast Asia to Australia and the Pacific. The shared flood story is one striking example of similar Eurasian myths according to the author; the ancient Middle East and Asia share other myth typologies, conspicuously including creation and Cain and Abel myths, which point to common origins in a progenitor culture. Absorbing, meticulously researched, limpidly written, and authoritative: should be regarded as a groundbreaking study of the remote past of Southeast Asia, and of civilization itself. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A close confidant of Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, George Gershwin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Knopfs, Van Vechten frolicked in the 1920s Manhattan demimonde, finding himself in Harlem's jazz clubs, Hell's Kitchen's speakeasies, and Greenwich Village's underground gay scene. New York City was a hotbed of vice as well as creativity, and Van Vechten was at the center of it all.<br>Edward White's biography&#x2015;the first comprehensive biography of Carl Van Vechten in nearly half a century, and the first to fully explore Van Vechten's tangled relationship to race and sexuality&#x2015;depicts a controversial figure who defined an age. Embodying many of the contradictions of modern America, Van Vechten was a devoted husband with a coterie of boys by his side, a supporter of difficult art who also loved lowbrow entertainment, and a promoter of the Harlem Renaissance whose bestselling novel&#x2015;and especially its title&#x2015;infuriated many of the same African-American artists he championed. Van Vechten's defense of what many Americans considered bad taste&#x2015;modernist literature, African-American culture, and sexual self-expression&#x2015;created a popular appetite for these quintessential elements of American art. <i>The Tastemaker</i> encompasses its subject's private fears and longings, as well as Manhattan's raucous, taboo-busting social scene of which he was such a central part. It is a remarkable portrait of a man whose brave journeys across boundaries of race, sexuality, and taste helped make America fully modern.</p></p><p><b>Edward White</b> studied European and American history at Mansfield College, Oxford, and Goldsmiths College, London.

White lives in London.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <i>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Yesterday</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>From the beginning of their adventure in America, the Van Vechtens did things their way&#x2014;with force, panache, and little regard for what others might think. The trend started with Teunis Dircksz Van Vechten, a twenty-eight-year-old farmer, who sailed with his wife and infant son from the Netherlands to the shores of the New World in the summer of 1638. Along with a dozen other farmers and merchants, the family set out from the tiny Dutch island of Texel aboard the <i>Arms of Norway</i> on May 12 and arrived in New Amsterdam nearly three months later on August 4 ready to transform the fecund, open land before them into their fortune. <br>After two years working as a laborer for another colonist, Teunis acquired the tenancy of a farm on the Rensselaerswijck patroonship, a vast manorial estate given by the West India Company to Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a diamond merchant from Amsterdam. Teunis was soon making a fine living for himself and his family, amassing enough money to buy a 50 percent stake in a nearby brewery. Like many Dutch pioneers of the time, the Van Vechtens were pulled toward America rather than pushed from Europe. It was the promise of prosperity and the prospect of adventure, not the need for sanctuary from religious persecution or crushing tyranny, that tempted them across the ocean. For that very reason, some found life on Rensselaerswijck hugely frustrating, as the impositions of the colony&#x2019;s rulers often seemed more exacting than those of the royal government back home. Yet few of the colonists made such a fuss as Teunis, who bridled at any attempt to impinge on his liberty. <br>If the patroonship records can be believed, Teunis was a hothead, an old-fashioned brawler, who liked to settle disagreements with his sharp tongue and sizable fists. But he was also a man of strong principle, whose lack of deference frequently enraged authorities. In 1651 he was prosecuted for publicly humiliating one official&#x2014;the director of the patroonship no less&#x2014;calling him &#x201c;an old grey thief and a rascal.&#x201d; More serious, he threatened to stab the Reverend Johannes Megapolensis with a knife; punishment, he said, for being &#x201c;an informer.&#x201d; Perhaps it had been Megapolensis who let slip that Teunis was selling produce at a price not sanctioned by the patroonship, a crime for which he received a further prosecution. There were other moments when the disdain for Old World bondage was less about taking a stand and more about indulging a wicked sense of humor. In September 1648, Teunis ordered a young employee at his brewery to fire a musket four times during the middle of the night, seemingly for the amusement of watching Jean Labatie, the self-important Frenchman in charge of the nearby Fort Orange, panicked into action. <br>These acts of rebellion were coupled with plenty of arduous endeavor. The Van Vechtens thrived in the New World, and by 1685 their coffers had grown sufficiently for Teunis&#x2019;s grandson Michael to buy a plot of around nine hundred acres in the vicinity of the Raritan River in New Jersey, where he built a large family home. Nearly a century later, the house played a crucial role in the Revolutionary War, when it was willingly loaned by its owner, Derrick Van Vechten, to Quartermaster Nathanael Greene during the Middlebrook campaign against the British in the winter of 1778&#x2013;79. Derrick Van Vechten had a reputation for throwing first-rate entertainments, and those he gave for Greene did not disappoint. At one soiree a high-spirited George Washington took a shine to the quartermaster&#x2019;s famously beautiful wife. &#x201c;His Excellency and Mrs. Greene danced upwards of three hours without once sitting down,&#x201d; reported Greene, &#x201c;a pretty little frisk.&#x201d; A lively, star-studded party in support of a revolutionary cause; Van Vechtens past and future would have been proud. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In the eight decades that elapsed after the Revolutionary War, the scope of American civilization drifted decisively westward, and at least one branch of the Van Vechten family drifted with it. By the time Carl Van Vechten was born in 1880, the family name was fast becoming one of the most important in the burgeoning state of Iowa. <br>In 1877 a fire razed the general store Van Vechten&#x2019;s parents, Charles and Ada, ran in Minneapolis, so they moved south to Cedar Rapids, where Charles&#x2019;s brother Giles had recently opened a bank. Known as the Parlor City because of its reputation for being a well-ordered and respectable community, Cedar Rapids was booming. Although founded in the 1840s, its real genesis moment came in 1859, when the arrival of the railroad transformed what had been a small town of just a few hundred people into an important player in the industrialization of Iowa farming. By the 1870s large grain-processing and meatpacking firms, including Quaker Oats in 1873, had set up in Cedar Rapids, transporting produce to Chicago and beyond in enormous quantities. The town boasted around ten thousand inhabitants when Charles and Ada arrived with the children; by the end of the century it was more than double that figure, making it one of the largest settlements in Iowa and one of the fastest-growing communities in the Midwest. <br>For industrious men like the Van Vechten brothers, Cedar Rapids held glittering prospects. After working as the cashier in his brother&#x2019;s bank for seven years, Charles struck out on a lucrative career in the insurance industry, an occupation he maintained well into his eighties. Throughout that time he strived hard to maintain a leading presence in the community. The fabric of civic life in Cedar Rapids was sewn together by voluntary associations of spirited individuals committed to the service of God and country, and Charles was involved in many of them; he sat as chairman of the cabinet at the First Universalist Church of Cedar Rapids and was a Mason, a Rotarian, and a member of the Knights Templar. The journalist William Shirer grew up in the Cedar Rapids of the early twentieth century and described it as &#x201c;churchy, Republican, wholesome,&#x201d; a pithy but accurate sketch of the ordered and genteel society that the elder Van Vechtens helped form. <br>Carl&#x2019;s arrival into the world came as something of a surprise to his parents. Born on June 17, 1880, he was by far the youngest of Charles and Ada&#x2019;s three children. Emma, their daughter, was thirteen when Carl was born; their son Ralph, already a strapping specimen of all-American masculinity, was nearly eighteen. Just entering middle age and assuming their years of child rearing were fast coming to an end, Van Vechten&#x2019;s parents were, he said, &#x201c;very surprised to have a visit from the stork,&#x201d; though the new baby was greeted joyously by the entire family. <br>Ada was besotted with her little boy, whom she regarded as a gift from the heavens. At thirty-nine she savored the pleasures of motherhood that she had been too anxious and inexperienced to enjoy with her first children. She set about recording every moment of Carl&#x2019;s young life as best she could in a journal solely devoted to his first three years. She studied him diligently as his personality developed, noting his burgeoning talents, the flourishing of his soft, cherubic features, and the joy that he brought her. &#x201c;My little boy&#x2019;s birthday,&#x201d; her entry for June 17, 1882, reads. &#x201c;Two years old, and oh what happy years they have been.&#x201d; His specialness to Ada peeks through the numerous photographs she had taken of him too. At eighteen months she sat him alone before the camera, posed on a crushed velvet armchair, wearing a black dress with a white lace collar, wisps of his long hair falling over his ears. He was a gorgeous, fat-cheeked baby with brown eyes like little pools of melted chocolate; it is easy to see why Ada found him so adorable. This was one of the first of many photographs that Ada arranged for Carl throughout his childhood, and it was she who introduced him to the camera&#x2019;s unique ability to extract and preserve beauty. <br>Other members of the family joined Ada in her efforts to make Carl feel precious and worthy of singular attention. During her pregnancy Ada&#x2019;s brother Charlie made a grand sentimental gesture, promising to write a special letter to the new baby every Christmas until he turned twenty-one. It seemed like a good idea at the time, and at first Charlie wrote charming letters about all the marvelous things that Santa might bring and how lucky Carl was to have been born a beautiful baby boy in the United States at a time of peace and plenty. But each year it became harder to find homespun wisdom worth committing to paper. Fearful that Carl might feel hurt or rejected, Ada could not bear the idea that her brother should stop the letters, so Charlie was compelled to continue the tradition. By the boy&#x2019;s ninth Christmas, Charlie said, the chore was enough to make a man &#x201c;tear wildly at his hair and roll his eyes upward in a pitiful way.&#x201d; <br>Among them, Ada, Charles, and the rest of the family spun around Carl a silken cocoon of genteel comfort. The family home, an elegant but restrained example of the Queen Anne architectural style so fashionable among the wealthy middle class in the late nineteenth century, had been gifted to Van Vechten&#x2019;s parents by Uncle Giles, whose success in banking had helped him build a considerable fortune. Giles&#x2019;s own house was a grand white-brick building with turrets, tall chimneys, and enormous bay windows &#x201c;surrounded by great oak trees, their spreading branches shading the well-kept lawn.&#x201d; In his 1924 novel, <i>The Tattooed Countess</i>, which drew upon his childhood for its setting, Van Vechten evoked Giles&#x2019;s house as a midwestern temple to an age of prosperity, temperance, and moral certainty. Charles never matched his brother&#x2019;s tremendous wealth&#x2014;worth millions in today&#x2019;s money&#x2014;but a combination of astute investment and hard work ensured that he and Ada always kept a beautifully furnished home, maintained by a retinue of three or four domestic servants, and Carl of course was treated to the finest of everything. <br>The family began each day at 7:30 a.m. sharp with a vast hourlong breakfast, the sort of honest, gargantuan meal that drove back the frontier and furred up the arteries all at once. Bowls of fresh fruit and oatmeal preceded a main course of sausages, bacon, eggs, fried steaks, and potatoes in cream, with pancakes, buckwheat, corn, and doughnuts thrown in for good measure, all augmented by pots of steaming tea and coffee and thick milk delivered each morning fresh from the udders of Uncle Giles&#x2019;s Jersey cow. The surrounding Iowan countryside offered a rural paradise for curious children. Immediately outside the town center there was a scraggy patchwork of mills, silos, grain elevators, and the other grimy apparatus of Cedar Rapids&#x2019;s fortune. But beyond that no suburbs, only the Corn Belt: fields and open meadows, lightly pocked by a scattering of small farmsteads among a flourish of brooks, maples, willows, and wildflowers. Van Vechten&#x2019;s connection to this landscape was forged early and remained his whole life. In its rolling, twisting hectares of green and pale yellows that shimmered and rippled in the summer breeze like an incoming tide he saw a deeply undervalued beauty that was &#x201c;essentially American&#x201d; and affected in him &#x201c;a kind of inspiration associated with great rivers, high mountains, or that mighty monster, Ocean,&#x201d; that others revered in more overtly dramatic locations. Old family photographs, some taken by Van Vechten himself, capture long summer days at Indian Creek, five or so miles from town, where he spent hours observing the wildlife, swimming in the warm, glistening waters, and camping out with his brother. <br>It would be hard to imagine a more indulged child in the state of Iowa. Van Vechten admitted he had probably been spoiled rotten as a boy. As the years passed, the material comforts and Ada&#x2019;s swaddling adoration fostered a self-centered and importunate nature within Carl. His idea of playing with other children was bossing them around, and delayed gratification was an entirely alien concept to him. &#x201c;I hated interference, objections of any kind,&#x201d; Van Vechten recalled of his childhood, though he could have easily been talking about his adult self. He made that observation in 1921 while looking at a deep scar that ran across his palm, a legacy of the time he grabbed a kitchen knife by the blade from his mother&#x2019;s hand, &#x201c;in a fury at not compelling her immediate attention.&#x201d; <br>Perhaps the impatience and egotism that caused his livid outbursts and squawking tantrums are not uncommon in children. The obsessiveness that began to exhibit itself around the age of twelve almost certainly is. It was at this time, during vacations at Uncle Charlie&#x2019;s house in Michigan, that Van Vechten&#x2019;s cousin Roy introduced him to collecting birds&#x2019; eggs. Roy was a studious young man, a bespectacled teenage oologist whose idea of a fun weekend was shinning up trees to study the nesting patterns of the eastern meadowlark. Taking just one egg from a nest, he maintained, was pointless. Only by taking a clutch&#x2014;that is, the entire contents of a nest&#x2014;could one hope to learn anything of value. Back home in Cedar Rapids, Van Vechten followed Roy&#x2019;s lead, not out of intellectual curiosity but rather to satisfy the acquisitiveness that was a fundamental part of his personality. He recalled that &#x201c;my mother, picturing the despair of the mother bird, begged me to leave at least one egg in each nest.&#x201d; He never did. Often the need to own and control the beautiful things in his orbit was so insistent it overruled all appeals to both heart and head, even when it risked hurting those who loved him the most. <br>A half century of ardent collecting began with those clutches of eggs. It was, ironically, a birdlike quality, a magpie&#x2019;s irresistible attraction to objects of ornament and beauty. Long after the ardor for birds had wilted, bangles and rings, objets d&#x2019;art, precious first editions, rare recordings, silk shirts, and brightly colored neckties in their hundreds all became collecting fixations of his. Anything elaborate and exquisite, anything new or novel he scooped into his embrace, as man and boy. Even when he could not justify the expense, he spent extravagantly on the latest things: a Victrola phonograph; a sharp new suit; a sleek portable typewriter. During one of his trips to Europe just prior to the First World War, he procured an object apparently unfamiliar to Americans at the time, a timepiece that instead of resting in a pocket was attached to a dainty leather bracelet and worn around the wrist. Returning from another overseas vacation some years later, he disembarked his ship surrounded by porters hauling his twenty-five pieces of luggage onto the dockside, the spoils of a frenzied shopping tour of the markets and department stores of Paris and London. <br>Guided by the same acquisitiveness, as a child he gathered a peculiar menagerie of pets: pigeons, thrushes, field mice, canaries, pigs, turtles, chameleons, and, so he claimed as an adult, even an alligator all passed through his protection at one point or another. None of them survived long, and when they died, he was never very bothered. In fact, even the deaths of family members troubled him relatively little as a boy. The passing of his grandmothers, both of whom lived in Cedar Rapids, one of them in his home, caused him no great anguish, and the same was seemingly true when his cousin Roy died tragically young and in blackly ironic circumstances, in an elevator accident in a hospital where he was receiving treatment for an illness. It was not until the age of twenty-five when his mother died that Van Vechten endured the common experiences of bereavement. &#x201c;Death, up to that time, had meant very little to me,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;People died,...</p><h2>Freedom&#39;s Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement from 1830 to 1970</h2><p>A collection of profiles of some of the fearless, resourceful female leaders of the Civil Rights Movement documents the accomplishments of Ida Wells, who led the protest against lynching; Pauli Murray, who organized the first lunch counter sit-in; Jo Ann Robinson, who helped launch the Montgomery bus boycott; and others. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Although men like Martin Luther King Jr. and Stokely Carmichael grabbed the headlines, women provided not just the backbone but frequently the leadership of the civil rights movement, this punchy popular history reminds us. And not just during the 1950s and '60s: Ida Mae Wells spearheaded an international anti-lynching campaign in 1892, Mary White Ovington helped launch the NAACP in 1909, and Pauli Murray led the first sit-in in 1944. The civil rights and feminist movements have been intertwined since the 19th century, notes Lynne Olson, who doesn't flinch from describing the ways in which sex has been used as a weapon to define and divide black and white women. Olson, coauthor of <i>The Murrow Boys</i>, again displays a marvelous knack for knitting sharp individual portraits into a cohesive group biography within a lively, accessible narrative. She makes it clear that women like Rosa Parks, Diane Nash, and Ida Mae Holland were not mere foot soldiers for male generals. Parks's record of civil rights work dated to the 1940s, long before she sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. The 22-year-old Nash revitalized the Freedom Rides after male colleagues nearly abandoned them in the wake of white violence. Holland transformed herself from an 18-year-old prostitute into a determined activist inspired by the older women she called "mamas" who could be seen on the front lines of every march, singing and testifying. Ella Baker, Jo Ann Robinson, Septima Clark, and Fannie Lou Hamer are among the other neglected figures who finally get their due in Olson's moving tribute. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Lynne Olson</b> and her husband, Stanley Cloud, cowrote <i>The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism.</i> She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and daughter.</p><h2>What Are Old People For?: How Elders Will Save the World</h2><p>Nodding to popular culture, history, science, and literature, a passionate and persuasive case is made for removing our ageist blinders and seeing old age as a developmental stage of life.</p><p>William H.

Since the hotel opened in 1926, it has styled itself a temple to exclusivity, boasting Italianate statues and manicured palm trees, a dazzling marina with slips for thirty-two yachts, a professional tennis club, a state-of-the-art spa, a designer golf course, and a beautiful strip of privatebeach. A glitzy roll call of celebrities and the wealthy have flocked to the resort, billed as a "private enclave of luxury," where they can relax well away from prying eyes.</p><p>On one summer's weekend back in June 1994, a quite different clientele descended: several dozen young bankers from the offices of J.P. Morgan in New York, London, and Tokyo. They were there for an off-site meeting, called to discuss how the bank could grow its derivatives business in the next year. In the humid summer heat, amid the palm trees and gracious arches, the group embraced the idea of a new type of derivative that would transform the wider world of twenty-first-century finance and play a decisive role in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. "It was in Boca where we started talking seriously about credit derivatives," recalls Peter Hancock, the British-born leader of the group. "That was where the idea really took off, where we really had a vision of how big it could be."</p><p>As with most intellectual breakthroughs, the exact origin of the concept of credit derivatives is hard to pinpoint. For Hancock, a highly cerebral man who likes to depict history as a tidy evolution of ideas, one step of the breakthrough occurred at the Boca Raton off-site. Some of his team, however, have only the haziest, alcohol-fuddled memories of that weekend. Full of youthful exuberance and a sense of entitlement, the young bankers had arrived in Florida determined to party as hard as they could.</p><p>They worked for the "swaps" department -- a particular corner of the derivatives universe -- which was one of the hottest, fastest-growing areas of finance. In the early 1980s, J.P. Morgan, along with several other venerable banks, had jumped into the newfangled derivatives field, and activity in the arcane business had exploded. By 1994, the total notional value of derivatives contracts on J.P. Morgan's books was estimated to be $1.7 trillion, and derivatives activity was generating half of the bank's trading revenue. In 1992 -- one year when J.P. Morgan broke out the number for public consumption -- the total was $512 million.</p><p>More startling than those numbers was the fact that most members of the banking and wider investing world had absolutely no idea how derivatives were producing such phenomenal sums, let alone what socalled swaps groups actually did. Those who worked in the area tended to revel in its air of mystery.</p><p>By the time of the Boca meeting, most of the J.P. Morgan group were still under thirty years old; some had just left college. But they were all convinced, with the heady arrogance of youth, that they held the secret to transforming the financial world, as well as dramatically enhancing J.P. Morgan's profit profile. Many arrived in Boca presuming the weekend was a lavish "thank you" from the bank management.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, they greeted each other with wild merriment and headed for the bars. Many had flown down from New York; a few had come from Tokyo; and a large contingent had flown over from London. Within minutes, drinking games got under way. As the night wore on, some of them commandeered a minivan to visit a local nightclub. Others hijacked golf carts and raced around the lawns. A large gaggle assembled around the main Boca Raton swimming pool threatening to throw one another in.</p><p>As the revelry around the pool intensified, Peter Voicke, a buttoned-up German who held the title head of global markets and, though only in his late forties, was the most senior official present, earnestly tried to calm them down. Voicke had agreed to stage the off-site in the hope it would forge camaraderie. "It is important to develop a healthy esprit de corps!" he liked to say in his flat Teutonic accent. But the camaraderie was getting out of hand. In no mood to heed his admonitions, several of them pushed Voicke into the pool. "My shoes, shoes!" he shouted, shocked, as expensive loafers drifted off his feet.</p><p>The drunken crowd then turned on Bill Winters, a jovial American who, at just thirty-one, was the second most senior official of them. Halfheartedly, he tried to dodge the crowd. But as he ducked, his face slammed into an incoming elbow, and a fountain of blood spurted out. "You've broken my nose!" Winters shouted, as he too tumbled into the pool. For a moment, the drunken laughter stopped. Voicke was obviously furious. Now Winters was hurt. But then Winters let out a laugh, hauled himself out of the pool, and clicked his nose back into place. The drinking games resumed.</p><p>At some banks, dousing the boss would have been a firing offense. But J.P. Morgan prided itself on a close-knit, almost fraternal culture. Those on the outside viewed the J.P. Morgan crowd as elitist and arrogant, overly enamored of the bank's vaunted history as a dominant force in American and British finance. Insiders often referred to the bank as a family. The derivatives group was one of the most unruly but also most tightly knit teams. "We had <i>real</i> fun -- there was a great spirit in the group back then," Winters would later recall with a wistful grin. When he and the rest of that little band looked back on those wild times, many said they were the happiest days of their lives.</p><p>One reason for that was the man running the team, Peter Hancock. At the age of thirty-five, he was only slightly older than many of the group, but he was their intellectual godfather. A large man, with thinning hair and clumsy, hairy hands, he exuded the genial air of a family doctor or university professor. Unlike many of those who came to dominate the complex finance world, Hancock sported no advanced degree in mathematics or science. Like most of the J.P. Morgan staff, he had joined the bank straight from getting his undergraduate degree, but notwithstanding the lack of a PhD, he was exceedingly cerebral, intensely devoted to the theory and practice of finance in all its forms. He viewed almost every aspect of the world around him as a complex intellectual puzzle to be solved, and he especially loved developing elaborate theories about how to push money around the world in a more efficient manner. When it came to his staff, he obsessively ruminated on how to build the team for optimal performance. Most of all, though, he loved brainstorming ideas.</p><p>Sometimes he did that in formal meetings, like the Boca off-site. But he also spewed out ideas on a regular basis as he strode around the bank's trading floor. The team called his exuberant outbursts of creativity "Come to Planet Pluto" moments, because many of the notions he tossed out seemed better suited to science fiction than banking. But they loved his intensity, and they were passionately loyal to him, knowing that he was fiercely devoted to protecting, and handsomely rewarding, his tribe. They were also bonded by the spirit of being pioneers.</p><p>The J.P. Morgan derivatives team was engaged in the banking equivalent of space travel. Computing power and high-order mathematics were taking finance far from its traditional bounds, and this small group of brilliant minds was charting the outer reaches of cyberfinance. Like scientists cracking the DNA code or splitting the atom, the J.P. Morgan swaps team believed their experiments in what bankers refer to as "innovation" -- meaning the invention of bold new ways of generating returns -- were solving the most foundational riddles of their discipline. "There was this sense that we had found this fantastic technology which we really believed in and we wanted to take to every part of the market we could," Winters later recalled. "There was a sense of mission."</p><p>That stemmed in part from Hancock's intense focus on the science of people management. He was almost as fascinated by how to manage people for optimal performance as by financial flows.</p><p>The moment he was appointed head of the derivatives group, Hancock had started experimenting with his staff. One of his first missions was to overhaul how his sales team and the traders interacted. Against all tradition, he decided to give the sales force the authority to quote prices for complex deals, instead of relying on the traders. He expected that doing so would more intensely motivate sales, and the change produced good results. He then started inventing new systems of remuneration designed to discourage taking excessive risks or hugging brilliant projects too close to the vest. He wanted to encourage collaboration and longer-term thinking, rather than self-interested pursuit of short-term gains. The teamwork ethos was already well entrenched at the bank, especially by comparison to most other Wall Street banks, but Hancock fervently believed that J.P. Morgan needed to go even further.</p><p>In later years, Hancock pushed his experimentation to unusual extremes. He hired a social anthropologist to study the corporate dynamics at the bank. He conducted firm-wide polls to ascertain which employees interacted most effectively with those from other departments, and he then used that data as a benchmark for assessing employee compensation, plotting it on complex, color-coded computer models. He was convinced that departments needed to interact closely with each other, so that they could swap ideas and monitor each other's risks. Silos, or fragmented departments, he believed, were lethal. At one stage he half-jokingly floated the idea of tracking employee emails, to measure the level of cross-departmental interaction in a scientific manner. The suggestion was blocked. "The human resources department thought I was barking mad!" he later recalled. "But if you want to create the conditions for...</p></p><h2>Be Shot for Sixpence: A Perennial British Mystery</h2><p>An announcement in The Times sets Philip on an intriguing trail through Europe.

What&#x2019;s special about this book is how Thomas takes us, slowly and somewhat unexpectedly, deep inside a family battling the gray-toned middling place of their middle-class existence. At the core is Eileen Tumulty Leary, urging her complacent husband and their impressionable son forward. Along the way, lives come and go. (&#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; her mother said, and in a little while she was dead.) There are some gorgeous scenes, some taut lines (I liked the air-conditioning unit&#x2019;s &#x201c;indefatigable wind&#x201d;), and some heartbreakers (a mother tells her son, at the funeral home, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably enough&#x201d;). It&#x2019;s thrilling to see an emerging writer test and flex his voice. Eileen and her husband are &#x201c;coconspirators in a mission of normalcy&#x201d;; in truth, there&#x2019;s occasionally too much normalcy in these 600 pages. Then again, it&#x2019;s oddly addictive to watch this family unfold, age, and devolve. Intimate, honest, and true, it&#x2019;s the story of a doomed father and a flawed son and the indefatigable and loving woman who keeps them all together, even as they&#x2019;re falling apart. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p>Matthew Thomas was born in the Bronx and grew up in Queens.

Tools</p><p>Our discussion won&#x2019;t include machines, only hand-held tools. How many tools you have in your sewing kit will depend on what you sew most often. Most of us have thimbles, various hand-sewing needles, measuring tape, tracing wheels, thread snips and scissors &#x2013; the basics. To build a corset you need all of these and a bit more. For those of you who are new to sewing we&#x2019;ll start with the basic tools listed above, then expand upon them and add a few new ones. Details on exactly how the tools are used will be found in other chapters. This list is to give you an idea of what tools you may need to acquire. </p><p><em>Thimble </em></p><p>Everyone knows what one looks like but it&#x2019;s surprising how many people don&#x2019;t know how or when to use one. </p><p><em>Why should you use a thimble?</em> Because you can&#x2019;t sew efficiently without one and doing so can be dangerous; particularly when sewing heavy fabric that may be difficult to get a needle through.</p><p>The thimble protects the middle finger of your sewing hand and gives you more power to push the needle through the fabric. Proper sewing technique requires that you enter the needle into the fabric while holding the needle between forefinger and thumb (A) and then follow through by pushing the needle through the fabric using your middle finger (B). The head of the needle can be very fine and even thicker needles can still puncture your finger before they go through all layers of fabric &#x2013; if you don&#x2019;t use a thimble for protection. Puncturing your finger will be painful, but worse; it will cause you to bleed and that means you&#x2019;ll get blood on the corset.</p><p>If you do happen to prick your finger and get blood on the garment, there is a very easy solution.</p><p>Blood is inclined to leave a permanent stain unless you use your saliva to dissolve it. Yes, it&#x2019;s true &#x2013; your saliva will remove the bloodstain &#x2013; but not if you try this after trying any other options. And only your saliva will dissolve your bloodstain so no one can help you with this. Simply spitting on the garment looks a bit vulgar, so take a yard or meter of thread, ball it up and chew it for a moment, let it get saturated, and then dab the stain with the saturated balled-up wad of thread and watch the bloodstain disappear. If you find this hard to believe, try it. </p><p><em>Hand-sewing Needles </em></p><p>They aren&#x2019;t what they used to be, which is one reason goggles are now part of many sewing rooms. Today&#x2019;s sewing needles tend to be brittle and can snap. Needles come in many sizes. Some sewing specialists will have clear ideas as to which sewing needle to use for which process. I am inclined to say, &#x201c;Use the needle that feels comfortable to hold.&#x201d; Very large ones aren&#x2019;t practical but a #6 or #7 seems to be reasonable for many purposes. You need hand-sewing needles so that you can finish the top and bottom edges of your corset by hand. </p><p><em>Measuring Tools </em></p><p>A measuring tape is for measuring the body and for checking measurements of the corset. A see-through ruler is my preferred tool for working on patterns and corsets because it not only offers a measuring device but a straightedge as well. I find I need both when corset making. Measuring can be more exact when using a ruler you can see through, and this makes the tracing of straight bone casing channels a lot faster. Nothing is better to aid you in marking bias strips on fabric than a see-through ruler! And bias strips are needed to finish a corset. </p><p><em>Tracing Wheel </em></p><p>The tracing wheel makes the job of marking all the bone casings much easier, although tailor&#x2019;s tacks can also be used by those who know how to make them. There are several types of tracing wheels: dressmaking, tailor&#x2019;s, and the double-wheel tracing wheel. The double-wheel is the most beneficial in corset making. By using it you cut your time in half for marking the casings, and increase your accuracy as the markings can&#x2019;t help but be perfectly parallel. The double-wheel tracing wheel can also be used to mark your seam allowances. Align one wheel on your cutting line and the other wheel on the stitching line and you can mark the stitching line perfectly parallel with the cutting line. </p><p><em>Awl </em></p><p>An awl is a tool that you won&#x2019;t likely be able to purchase in your local fabric store but you&#x2019;ll find one in almost any hardware store. It&#x2019;s used when you need to apply an opening busk. The unique thing about making a hole with an awl is that the threads of the fabric get separated and pushed apart so they don&#x2019;t get cut or broken, and the integrity of the fabric isn&#x2019;t diminished. If you use a hole punch or scissors to create a hole the threads tend to fray and the hole gets bigger; something you want to avoid. This will create a very difficult mending job that will be costly and time consuming.</p><p>An awl is very simple to use. Simply work the point of the awl between the threads of the fabric where you&#x2019;ve marked the hole placement and continue to push the awl through, spreading the threads further and further apart until you have a hole the size you need. Details of this process can be found in Section 2 Chapter 6.</p><p>If you can&#x2019;t find an awl, you can use a well-sharpened pencil &#x2013; but be sure the pencil color is a close match to your fabric as the pencil needs to be very sharp and the lead will be exposed and will mark your fabric.</p><p>A hole punch, rubber mallet, bolt cutters, tin snips, file, and needle-nose pliers are also not likely to be found at your local fabric store, but you may find them in your toolbox. If not, any hardware store should have them. </p><p><em>Thread Snips </em></p><p>Thread snips and scissors are used for cutting out the pattern pieces and snipping the multitude of threads left at the top and bottom of the corset where the bone casing stitching ends. There are a lot of threads since every bone casing requires two rows of stitching. Some Janome sewing machines offer a thread clipping option, but if you don&#x2019;t have one of these high-end machines you&#x2019;ll need to do a lot of clipping by hand. If you&#x2019;re using bone casing ribbon you&#x2019;ll also need to be able to cut the ribbon to length. </p><p><em>Rotary Cutter </em></p><p>A rotary cutter isn&#x2019;t absolutely necessary but can make cutting out your pattern pieces easier and saves stress on your hands if you&#x2019;re cutting a lot. To use a rotary cutter you must have a rotary cutting mat to protect your table. Rotary cutters and mats can be purchased at most fabric shops.</p><p>Earlier we referred to the importance of using an awl rather than cutting a hole to avoid compromising the strength of the fabric. Some people use an awl to form the holes for the grommets or eyelets as well. However this can be a challenging and time-consuming process as there are far more grommets and eyelets than busk knobs, and they tend to be larger than the busk knobs &#x2013; so grommets are more difficult to force through the awl-made hole. The theory is that by using an awl you won&#x2019;t decrease the strength of the fabric where the grommets/eyelets are set as the threads will remain intact. As a result the grommets will be less inclined to pop out of the fabric. This is true to some extent but using a washer behind the grommet or eyelet increases the security of the grommet or eyelet far more than not cutting a hole would. </p><p><em>Hole Punches </em></p><p>To make a hole you need a hole punch. Hole punches will come with any grommet or eyelet kit you purchase. It&#x2019;s imperative that the hole you make is the correct size. This will be assured if you use the hole punch that comes with the kit, and then order more grommets or eyelets in the same size as those included in the kit. </p><p><em>Rubber Mallet </em></p><p>Rubber mallets are useful in setting grommets. <em>Don&#x2019;t use a regular metal hammer,</em> as the metal hammer striking the metal grommet setter is unsafe. If you can&#x2019;t get a rubber mallet try a rawhide or wooden one. Details on setting grommets or eyelets can be found in Section 2 Chapter7. There are other means of closing the back of your corset so if you decide not to use grommets or eyelets then you won&#x2019;t need a rubber mallet. Decide how you&#x2019;ll finish the corset before you buy the tool. See Section 2 Chapter 8 for other options. </p><p><em>Bolt Cutters </em></p><p>Bolt cutters can sometimes be found at dollar stores, but don&#x2019;t waste your money on them. They tend not to do the job, and if they work at first they don&#x2019;t last until the end of the project. The movement of the jaws of a bolt cutter can make it a better cutting tool than tin snips for some steel. The jaws of a bolt cutter are parallel to one another and clamp down in a way that applies pressure to the whole piece of steel at one time &#x2013; unlike tin snips which function more like scissors. This means that the steel can&#x2019;t slide out from between the jaws. Bolt cutters are a better choice for spiral steel bones and narrower spring steels. Details on how to cut steel can be found in Section 2 Chapters 4 and 5.</p><p>Tin snips are another tool for cutting steel bones. Some bones cut more easily with bolt cutters and some with tin snips. Like bolt cutters, tin snips shouldn&#x2019;t be purchased at the dollar or discount store. Regardless of brand name the tin snips should have serrated jaws as they&#x2019;ll grip the steel better and don&#x2019;t allow the steel to slide out from between the jaws. Tin snips function in the same way scissors do, so lack of a serrated jaw means the bone will slide out of the jaws as they close.</p><p>Tin snips are best for spring steel, particularly wider spring steels, and for plastic as well.</p><p>Details on cutting bones and which tools to use for what type of bone can be found in Section 2 Chapters 4 and 5. </p><p><em>File </em></p><p>A file may be needed if you&#x2019;re cutting steel bones. You may need to file off the rough or sharp corne...</p></p><h2>Forgotten Arts: Yesterday&#39;s Techniques Adapted to Today&#39;s Materials, Book 2</h2><p>interesting reading</p><p></p><h2>The Rookie&#39;s Guide to Options: The Beginner&#39;s Handbook of Trading Equity Options</h2><p>Learn to use options from veteran option trader Mark D Wolfinger, who spent more than 20 years as a market maker on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

With so many good knives available, you might ask, why would anyone want to make one by hand? <p>That very question coursed through my mind when a friend who worked in the office next to mine began talking to me about the knives he was making. Almost every day he would work the word knife into our conversations in some way. And samples of the different blades he was making would be placed casually on his desk, used as paperweights and letter openers. </p><p>I was surprised by the beauty and especially the uniqueness of those handmade knives. They were sleek and graceful, with a more personal and mellow look than commercial knives. I knew that my friend was strictly a beginner at this craft. And he had no great amount of experience in metal or woodworking, either. Yet after just a few weeks of experience, he was making beautiful knives. </p><p>Finally, his goading got to me, and I ordered a blade from a company selling knifemaking supplies. My initial project was not to make a whole knife, but just to fashion a handle for a blade that had been turned out by machine. Soon I was gluing, cutting, filing, grinding, and sanding away at my own knife project. </p><p>My knifemaking lasted perhaps a year, and I turned out three knives before directing my attention to other crafts and recreations. But I was happy to have had the experience, not so much because I made exceptional knives but because I was able to feel the relationship that develops between a person and a knife that is made for personal use. </p><p>A knife is perhaps the most basic and useful of all tools. Most of us develop favorites among the knives we keep in our homes for kitchen use, gardening, sport, and carving. When you reach for a knife, you automatically feel for the one that you like, that has served you best in the past, or that has some unique attraction to you that is hard to explain. </p><p>When you have made a knife yourself and have shaped the blade just the way you want it and the handle is made to fit your own hand, a special relationship develops between you and that tool. David Boye says that effectively and even eloquently in this book, but putting the feeling into words captures only part of the experience. Just as you feel the handle of a knife, you also feel the specialness of a handle that is of your own making. And when you have ground and filed a blade to suit a purpose that is clear in your own mind, you have a special, more personal feeling when you use that blade. </p><p>In this age when we are flooded with machine-made products for almost every conceivable purpose, the experience of making and using your own special knife becomes more important. Making a knife is like fashioning a key to a wider awareness of your own abilities and relationship to tools. These days, we have too few such opportunities. </p><p>- Robert Rodale<br>Rodale Press <br>(original publisher)</p>David Boye has been a full time artist knifemaker since 1972. He is on the leading edge of blademaking science through his historic discovery and development of Dendritic Steel and Dendritic Cobalt. <p> </p><p>Completely self-taught, David started making knives from used sawmill blades. In 1976, Rodale Press published his book, Step-by-Step Knifemaking, which explains how to make knives using recycled materials and readily available equipment. This popular text has sold over 150,000 copies to date, and has influenced the careers of many custom knifemakers working today. </p><p>In 1980, David began experimenting with the technique of investment casting for making knife blades. He discovered that casting produces a dendritic (fern-like) network of carbide crystals throughout the steel, and that dendritic steel blades hold an edge from 2 to 50 times longer than other steels commonly used for cutlery. His work is considered to be a revolutionary breakthrough in modern knifemaking. </p><p>David was born in San Mateo in 1941, and grew up in the Bay Area. His academic background was primarily in psychology (B.A. San Jose State, 1964, M.A. San Jose State, 1965), and included a minor in Art. He also completed 2 and 1/2 years towards a doctorate degree in Social Psychology at the University of Minnesota. </p><p>David makes a variety of knives for the home and the outdoors. He specializes in a dendritic cobalt boat knife, which was rated #1 Sailor's Knife by the highly respected, independent journal Practical Sailor. His work has been shown in more than 50 galleries and museums, including the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., as well as in Japan and Europe. Boye knives have been featured in numerous articles in both national and local publications.</p></p><h2>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</h2><p><b>This edition of <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> by Friedrich Nietzsche boasts an authoritative English translation, allowing the reader strong comprehension of the text.</b> <br><br> First published between 1883 and 1891, this philosophical novel is written in a distinct and original style which combines dialogue with verse. It established Nietzsche as a bold and original thinker; a reputation that would only be enhanced by later works such as <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>. <br><br> <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> has several recurring themes, placing the main character - the creator of one of the first monotheistic faiths - in a story which deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the �bermensch. This combination proved potent in philosophic circles, with the text passionately discussed in academic circles to this day. <br><br> As well as its digestible translation, the book also contains an introduction by the sister of Friedrich Nietzsche, Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche, explaining her sibling's convictions and motivations behind authoring this philosophic book.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was a nihilist philosopher, critic and poet who wrote several works of philosophy which have proven strongly influential since their initial publication in the late 19th century. After beginning his academic career as an expert in ancient Greek and Latin, Nietzsche would steadily advance into philosophy, becoming more convinced and sure of his arguments as time went by. Gradually, his writings became more polemical and provocative, criticising earlier philosophers, established institutions such as the Christian church, and its moral tenets in a series of vehement and swiftly paced writings which at times veer into humorous sarcasm. Nietzsche&#39;s final work was The Antichrist, which was completed a short time before a mental breakdown which rendered the scholar incapacitated for the final decade of his life. By the time of his death in 1900 at the age of 55, Nietzsche had assembled a large and devoted following, particularly within academic and scholarly circles, which continues to this day., also translated as Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Treatise by Friedrich Nietzsche, written in four parts and published in German between 1883 and 1885 as Also sprach Zarathustra. The work is incomplete, but it is the first thorough statement of Nietzsche&#39;s mature philosophy and the masterpiece of his career. It received little attention during his lifetime but its influence since his death has been considerable, in the arts as well as philosophy. Written in the form of a prose narrative, Thus Spake Zarathustra offers the philosophy of its author through the voice of Zarathustra (based on the Persian prophet Zoroaster) who, after years of meditation, has come down from a mountain to offer his wisdom to the world. It is this work in which Nietzsche made his famous (and much misconstrued) statement that &#34;God is dead&#34; and in which he presented some of the most influential and well-known (and likewise misunderstood) ideas of his philosophy, including those of the Ubermensch (&#34;overman&#34; or &#34;superman&#34;) and the &#34;will to power.&#34; Though this is essentially a work of philosophy, it is also a masterpiece of literature. The book is a combination of prose and poetry, including epigrams, dithyrambs, and parodies as well as sections of pure poetry. --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</p><h2>Empowered Horses: Learning Their Way Through Independence, Self-Confidence, and Creative Play</h2><p><br><p>With&nbsp;illuminating text, this study explains why it is necessary for riders to carefully build a relationship&nbsp;that eliminates the traditional rider-as-oppressor dynamic and instead empowers the horse to behave as an individual.

While these things are great, you may need to know and store more when long-term crisis hits. So, what do you do?<br> <br> Many people do not realize that a first-aid kit is not sufficient for many survival situations, especially those that last for an extended period of time. The problem is that if you need medicine, you are not going to be able to find it. You cannot go to the doctor and it&#x2019;s likely that your local pharmacy has already been raided for supplies. It is in these trying times where survival is essential. <br> <br> <b>What Exactly is Survival Medicine?</b><br> Survival medicine is the knowledge and ability to care for everything from small scratches to serious injuries in an emergency. It is a skill that can save you, your family, and anyone else you may encounter that needs help. <br> <br> <b>Why Survival Medicine is Important</b><br> Many people look at survival medicine as stocking up on some helpful over-the-counter medicines and coverings for wounds for their survival kit. However, survival medicine entails much more. To be adequately prepared, you must know what to do once your supplies run out. Survival medicine teaches you about common ailments, good over-the-counter medications to stock up on, and how to use your surroundings to make medicine in an emergency, by relying on herbs, berries, and other plants. <br> <br> Disasters like political unrest, natural events, or an apocalypse can last a few days, a few months, or even longer. Events during this time are unpredictable. The conditions of the situation and the stress that the people living through it undergo result in an elevated risk of injury. Because of unsanitary conditions, illnesses are also common. This is especially true once you run out of your stored food supply and need to rely on supplementing from nature. By brushing up on your survival medicine, you can save your own life, the life of someone you love, or the life of a stranger. <br> <br> With this, you'll be able to think on your feet and potentially save someone's life.</p><p></p><h2>Lady from Savannah: The Life of Juliette Low</h2><p>Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. is proud to reissue Lady from Savannah in response to widespread demands for a biography of our Founder, Juliette Gordon Low. In truth, however, this is much more than the story of one woman and the organization she started. It is first of all a chronicle of two great American families - the Kinzies who were founders of Chicago and the Gordons whose name is magic to this day in Savannah, Georgia - that in 1860 produced the gallant, willful, exasperating, generous, and wholly lovable Juliette (known as Daisy) Gordon. The narrative of Daisy&#39;s marriage to Willy Low also offers insider&#39;s view of Edwardian high society in England.

Lilly revisits her past, going back to the moment she was forced to flee Ireland, at the end of the First World War, and continues her tale in America, a world filled with both hope and danger. At once epic and intimate, Lilly's story unfolds as she tries to make sense of the sorrows and troubles of her life and of the people whose lives she has touched. Spanning nearly seven decades, from the Great Depression to World War II and the Vietnam War, it is the heartbreaking story of a woman whose capability to love is enormous, and whose compassion, even for those who have wronged her, is astonishing.</p><p>Sebastian Barry was born in Dublin in 1955. His plays include <i>Boss Grady's Boys</i> (1988), <i>The Steward of Christendom</i> (1995), <i>Our Lady of Sligo</i> (1998), <i>The Pride of Parnell Street</i> (2007), and <i>Dallas Sweetman</i> (2008). Among his novels are <i>The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty</i> (1998), <i>Annie Dunne</i> (2002) and <i>A Long Long Way</i> (2005), the latter shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. His poetry includes <i>The Water-Colourist</i> (1982), <i>Fanny Hawke Goes to the Mainland Forever</i> (1989) and <i>The Pinkening Boy</i> (2005). His awards include the Irish-America Fund Literary Award, The Christopher Ewart-Biggs Prize, the London Critics Circle Award, The Kerry Group Irish Fiction Prize, and Costa Awards for Best Novel and Book of the Year. He lives in Wicklow with his wife Ali, and three children, Merlin, Coral, and Tobias.&#x201c;Sebastian Barry&#x2019;s achievement, enhanced by his latest novel, <i>On Canaan&#x2019;s Side</i>, may be too great to be defined by the Booker or any other literary prize. Barry, the greatest prose writer in Irish letters&#x2014;which by definition makes him the greatest writer of prose in the English language...No other novelist now writing can convey as Barry does the way in which unrighted wrongs continue to reverberate down through the ages, creating new versions of old tragedies for people with no knowledge of their origins...<i>On Canaan&#x2019;s Side </i>fits seamlessly into Barry&#x2019;s unique and expanding vision, seeking to restore with language that which has been taken away by time. Its real subject isn&#x2019;t politics or even history but memory, a memory which reveals that &#x2018;a measure of tragedy is stitched into everything if you follow the thread long through.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Allen Barra, The Daily Beast "Must Reads"</b><br><br>&#x201c;Richly detailed, often cinematic...This is no self-indulgent apologia, and Irish writer Sebastian Barry makes the fine distinction between sentiment and sentimentality with a deft hand...With all the quiet interiority and the equanimity with which events are recalled here, it&#x2019;s easy to overlook how exciting those events were. The &#x201c;plot&#x201d; is full of surprises &#x2013; many shocking. War, single parenthood, betrayal, unexpected acts of compassion, death too early &#x2013; or in at least one case, too late &#x2013; and race relations are all threads in the tapestry of Lilly&#x2019;s life. Accommodations must be made at every turn and Lilly makes them, all the while maintaining her own moral poise. Deservedly short-listed twice previously for the Man Booker Prize, Barry in his current offering maintains, and at times exceeds, the high level of finely wrought empathy attained in those award nominees...And as in those two novels, the play of history as it most intimately affects individual lives in such an infinite variety of ways is on exquisitely touching display.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>The Philadelphia Inquirer</b><br><br>&#x201c;Lilly Bere is exceptional. She frees herself from one homeland and takes root in another. Her story is as American as it is Irish...elegiac...this Dubliner&#x2019;s portrayal of our city feels organic. From the East Ohio Gas explosion to a run-in with racism at Luna Park, he weaves a rich, authentic backdrop.

The air was hot and moist; birds were singing in the trees. On her hands and knees, she stabbed the dirt, chopping it loose. One handful at a time, she scooped it away. Some of the weakness had abated but not all. Her body felt loose, disorganized, drained. There was pain, and the memory of pain. Three days had passed, or was it four? Perspiration beaded on her face; she licked her lips to taste the salt. She dug and dug. The sweat ran in rivulets, falling into the earth. That&#x2019;s where everything goes, Alicia thought, in the end. Everything goes into the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pile beside her swelled. How deep was enough? Three feet down, the soil began to change. It became colder, with the odor of clay. It seemed like a sign. She rocked back on her boots and took a long drink from her canteen. Her hands were raw; the flesh at the base of her thumb had peeled back in a sheet. She placed the web of her hand to her mouth and used her teeth to sever the flap of skin and spat it into the dirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soldier was waiting for her at the edge of the clearing, his jaws loudly working on a stand of waist--high grass. The grace of his haunches, his rich mane and blue roan coat, the magnificence of his hooves and teeth and the great black marbles of his eyes: an aura of splendor surrounded him. He possessed, when he chose, an absolute calm, then, in the next moment, could perform remarkable deeds. His wise face lifted at the sound of her approach. <i>I see. We&#x2019;re ready.</i> He turned in a slow arc, his neck bent low, and followed her into the trees to the place where she had pitched her tarp. On the ground beside Alicia&#x2019;s bloody bedroll lay the small bundle, swaddled in a stained blanket. Her daughter had lived less than an hour, yet in that hour Alicia had become a mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soldier watched as she emerged. The baby&#x2019;s face was covered; Alicia drew back the cloth. Soldier bent his face to the child&#x2019;s, his nostrils flaring, breathing in her scent. Tiny nose and eyes and rosebud mouth, startling in their humanness; her head was covered in a cap of soft red hair. But there was no life, no breath. Alicia had wondered if she would be capable of loving her&#x2014;-this child conceived in terror and pain, fathered by a monster. A man who had beaten her, raped her, cursed her. How foolish she&#x2019;d been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to the clearing. The sun was directly overhead; insects buzzed in the grass, a rhythmic pulsing. Soldier stood beside her as she laid her daughter in the grave. When her labor had started, Alicia had begun to pray. <i>Let her be all right.</i> As the hours of agony dissolved into one another, she had felt death&#x2019;s cold presence inside her. The pain pounded through her, a wind of steel; it echoed in her cells like thunder. Something was wrong. <i>Please, God, protect her, protect us.</i> But her prayers had fallen into the void.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first handful of soil was the hardest. How did one do it? Alicia had buried many men. Some she&#x2019;d known, and some she hadn&#x2019;t; only one she&#x2019;d loved. The boy, Hightop. So funny, so alive, then gone. She let the dirt sift through her fingers. It struck the cloth with a pattering sound, like the first spits of rain upon leaves. Bit by bit her daughter disappeared. <i>Goodbye,</i> she thought, <i>goodbye, my darling, my one.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to her tent. Her soul felt shattered, like a million chips of glass inside her. Her bones were tubes of lead. She needed water, food; her stores were exhausted. But hunting was out of the question, and the creek, a five--minute walk down the hillside, felt like miles away. The needs of the body: what did they matter? Nothing mattered. She lay on her bedroll and closed her eyes, and soon she was asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She dreamed of a river. A wide, dark river, and above it the moon was shining. It laid its light across the water like a golden road. What lay ahead Alicia did not know, only that she needed to cross this river. She took her first cautious step upon its glowing surface. Her mind felt divided: half marveled at this unlikely mode of travel; the other half did not. As the moon touched the far shore, she realized she had been deceived. The shining pathway was dissolving. She broke into a run, desperate to reach the other side before the river swallowed her. But the distance was too great; with every step she took, the horizon leapt farther away. The water sloshed around her ankles, her knees, her waist. She had no strength to fight its pull. <i>Come to me, Alicia. Come to me, come to me, come to me.</i> She was sinking, the river was taking her, she was plunging into darkness&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She awoke to a muted orange light; the day had nearly passed. She lay motionless, assembling her thoughts. She had grown accustomed to these nightmares; the pieces changed but never the feeling of them&#x2014;-the futility, the fear. Yet this time something was different. An aspect of the dream had traveled into life; her shirt was sopping. She looked down to see the widening stains. Her milk had come in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>* </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Staying was not a conscious decision; the will to move on was simply absent. Her strength returned. It approached with small steps; then, like a guest long awaited, it arrived all at once. She constructed a shelter of deadfall and vines, using the tarp as a roof. The woods abounded with life: squirrels and rabbits, quail and doves, deer. Some were too quick for her but not all. She set traps and waited to collect her kill or took them on her cross: one shot, a clean death, then dinner, raw and warm. At the end of each day when the light had faded, she bathed in the creek. The water was clear and shockingly cold. It was on such an excursion that she saw the bears. A rustling ten yards upstream, something heavy moving in the brush; then they appeared at the edge of the creek, a mother and a pair of cubs. Alicia had never seen such creatures in the flesh, only in books. They prowled the shallows together, pushing the mud with their snouts. There was something loose and half--formed about their anatomy, as if the muscles were not firmly stitched to the skin beneath their heavy, twig--tangled coats. A cloud of insects sparkled around them, catching the last of the light. But the bears did not appear to notice her or, if they did, did not think she was important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The summer faded. One day, a world of fat green leaves, dense with shadow; then the woods exploded with riotous color. In the morning, the floor of the forest crunched with frost. Winter&#x2019;s cold descended with a feeling of purity. Snow lay heavy on the land. The black lines of the trees, the small footprints of birds, the whitewashed sky, bleached of all tone: everything had been pared to its essence. What month was it? What day? As time wore on, food became a problem. For hours, whole days even, she barely moved, conserving her strength; she hadn&#x2019;t spoken to a living soul in nearly a year. Gradually it came to her that she was no longer thinking in words, as if she had become a creature of the forest. She wondered if she was losing her mind. She began to talk to Soldier, as if he were a person. <i>Soldier,</i> she would say, <i>what should we have for dinner? Soldier, do you think it&#x2019;s time to gather wood for the fire? Soldier, does the sky look like snow?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One night she awoke in the shelter and realized that for some time she&#x2019;d been hearing thunder. A wet spring wind was blowing in directionless gusts, hurling around in the treetops. With a feeling of detachment, Alicia listened to the storm&#x2019;s approach; then it was suddenly upon them. A blast of lightning forked the sky, freezing the scene in her eyes, followed by an earsplitting clap. She let Soldier inside as the heavens opened, ejecting raindrops heavy as bullets. The horse was shivering with terror. Alicia needed to calm him; just one panicked movement in the tiny space and his massive body would blow the shelter to pieces. <i>You&#x2019;re my good boy,</i> she murmured, stroking his flank. With her free hand she slipped the rope around his neck. <i>My good, good boy. What do you say? Keep a girl company on a rainy night?</i> His body was tense with fear, a wall of coiled muscle, and yet when she applied slow force to draw him downward, he allowed it. Beyond the walls of the shelter, the lightning flashed, the heavens rolled. He dropped to his knees with a mighty sigh, turned onto his side beside her bedroll, and that was how the two of them slept as the rain poured down all night, washing winter away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She abided in that place for two years. Leaving was not easy; the woods had become a solace. She had taken its rhythms as her own. But when Alicia&#x2019;s third summer began, a new feeling stirred: the time had come to move on. To finish what she&#x2019;d started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She passed the rest of the summer preparing. This involved the construction of a weapon. She left on foot for the river towns and returned three days later, hauling a clanking bag. She understood the basics of what she was attempting, having watched the process many times; the details would come through trial and error. A flat--topped boulder by the creek would serve as her anvil. At the water&#x2019;s edge, she stoked her fire and watched it burn down to coals. Maintaining the right temperature was the trick. When she felt she had it right, she removed the first piece from the sack: a bar of O1 steel, two inches wide, three feet long, three--eighths of an inch thick. From the sack she also withdrew a hammer, iron tongs, and thick leather gloves. She placed the end of the steel bar in the fire and watched its color change as the metal heated. Then she got to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took three more trips downriver for supplies, and the results were crude, but in the end she was satisfied. She used coarse, stringy vines to wrap the handle, giving her fist a solid purchase on the otherwise smooth metal. Its weight was pleasant in her grip. The polished tip shone in the sun. But the first cut would be the true test. On her final trip downriver, she had wandered upon a field of melons, the size of human heads. They grew in a dense patch, tangled with vines of grasping, hand--shaped leaves. She&#x2019;d selected one and carried it home in the sack. Now she balanced it atop a fallen log, took aim, and brought the sword down in a vertical arc. The severed halves rocked lazily away from each other, as if stunned, and flopped to the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing remained to hold her in place. The night before her departure, Alicia visited her daughter&#x2019;s grave. She did not want to do this at the last second; her exit should be clean. For two years the place had gone unmarked. Nothing had seemed worthy. But leaving it unacknowledged felt wrong. With the last of her steel, she&#x2019;d fashioned a cross. She used the hammer to tap it into the ground and knelt in the dirt. The body would be nothing now. Perhaps a few bones, or an impression of bones. Her daughter had passed into the soil, the trees, the rocks, even the sky and animals. She had gone into a place beyond knowing. Her untested voice was in the songs of birds, her cap of red hair in the flaming leaves of autumn. Alicia thought about these things, one hand touching the soft earth. But she had no more prayers inside her. The heart, once broken, stayed broken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Morning dawned unremarkably&#x2014;-windless, gray, the air compacted with mist. The sword, sheathed in a deer--hide scabbard, lay across her back at an angle; her blades, tucked in their bandoliers, were cinched in an X over her chest. Dark, gogglelike glasses, with leather shields at the temples, concealed her eyes. She fixed the saddlebag in place and swung onto Soldier&#x2019;s back. For days he&#x2019;d roamed restlessly, sensing their imminent departure. <i>Are we doing what I think we&#x2019;re doing? I rather like it here, you know.</i> Her plan was to ride east along the river, to follow its course through the mountains. With luck, she&#x2019;d reach New York before the first leaves fell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She closed her eyes, emptying her mind. Only when she had cleared this space would the voice emerge. It came from the same place dreams did, like wind from a cave, whispering into her ear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Alicia, you are not alone. I know your sorrow, because it&#x2019;s my own. I&#x2019;m waiting for you, Lish. Come to me. Come home.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She tapped Soldier&#x2019;s flanks with her heels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The day was just ending when Peter returned to the house. Above him, the immense Utah sky was breaking open in long fingers of color against the deepening blue. An evening in early autumn: the nights were cold, the days still fair. He made his way homeward along the murmuring river, his pole over his shoulder, the dog ambling at his side. In his bag were two fat trout, wrapped in golden leaves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he approached the farmstead, he heard music coming from the house. He removed his muddy boots on the porch, put down his bag, and eased inside. Amy was sitting at the old upright piano, her back facing the door. He moved in quietly behind her. So total was her concentration that she failed to notice his entry. He listened without moving, barely with breath. Amy&#x2019;s body was swaying slightly to the music. Her fingers moved nimbly up and down the keyboard, not so much playing the notes as calling them forth. The song was like a sonic embodiment of pure emotion. There was a deep heartache inside its phrases, but the feeling was expressed with such tenderness that it did not seem sad. It made him think of the way time felt, always falling into the past, becoming memory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re home.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The song had ended without his noticing. As he placed his hands on her shoulders, she shifted on the bench and tilted her face upward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He bent to receive her kiss. Her beauty was astonishing, a fresh discovery every time he looked at her. He tipped his head at the keys. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know how you do that,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you like it?&#x201d; She was smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been practicing all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He told her he did; he loved it. It made him think of so many things, he said. It was hard to put into words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How was the river? You were gone a long while.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Was I?&#x201d; The day, like so many, had passed in a haze of contentment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so beautiful this time of year, I guess I just lost track.&#x201d; He kissed the top of her head. Her hair was freshly washed, smelling of the herbs she used to soften the harsh lye. &#x201c;Just play. I&#x2019;ll get dinner going.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He moved through the kitchen to the back door and into the yard. The garden was fading; soo...</p></p><h2>Munch</h2><p><strong>Fear, desperation, and death: Painting as an act of self-liberation</strong> &nbsp; For Edvard Munch (1863-1944), painting was an act of self-liberation. His treatments of fear, desperation, and death still exert a powerful visual and psychological effect on modern viewers. Of all Munch&#x2019;s paintings, "The Scream" (1893), representing a figure tortured by horror, is the most well-known-and certainly one of the most expressive.<br> <br> The artist reflected his innermost feelings in his work: "In reality, my art is a free confession, an attempt to clarify to myself my own relation to life..."

Buildings often overawe us with their beauty. Architecture is both setting for our everyday lives and public art form&#x2015;but it remains mysterious to most of us.<br> In <i>How Architecture Works</i>, Witold Rybczynski, one of our best, most stylish critics and winner of the Vincent Scully Prize for his architectural writing, answers our most fundamental questions about how good&#x2015;and not-so-good&#x2015;buildings are designed and constructed. Introducing the reader to the rich and varied world of modern architecture, he takes us behind the scenes, revealing how architects as different as Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano, and Robert A. M. Stern envision and create their designs. He teaches us how to "read" plans, how buildings respond to their settings, and how the smallest detail&#x2015;of a stair balustrade, for instance&#x2015;can convey an architect's vision. Ranging widely from a war memorial in London to an opera house in St. Petersburg, from the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., to a famous architect's private retreat in downtown Princeton, <i>How Architecture Works</i>, explains the central elements that make up good building design. It is an enlightening humanist's toolkit for thinking about the built environment and seeing it afresh.<br> "Architecture, if it is any good, speaks to all of us," Rybczynski writes. This revelatory book is his grand tour of architecture today.</p></p><p><p><b>Witold Rybczynski</b> has written about architecture for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Slate</i>. Among his award-winning books are <i>Home</i>, <i>The Most Beautiful House in the World</i>, and <i>A Clearing in the Distance</i>, which won the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. He lives with his wife in Philadelphia, where he is the emeritus professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. <i>How Architecture Works</i> is his eighteenth book.</p><i>1</i> <br> <i>IDEAS</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The �cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which dominated architectural education in the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, developed a strict method of teaching building design. After being assigned a problem, the student was isolated in a cubicle without the benefit of books or external advice, and given twelve hours to produce an <i>esquisse</i>, or preliminary design sketch. The chief purpose of this exercise was to decide on a <i>parti</i>, the governing idea that the student would turn into a detailed design over the next two months. A student handbook advised, &#x201c;Selecting a <i>parti</i> for a problem is to take an attitude toward a solution in the hope that a building developed on the lines indicated by it will give the best solution of the problem.&#x201d; Although the <i>esquisse</i> is a thing of the past, the term <i>parti</i> has survived, for it embodies an enduring truth: great buildings are often the result of a single&#x2014;and sometimes very simple&#x2014;idea. <br>When you enter the Pantheon in Rome, you take it all in at a single glance: a vast drum supporting a coffered dome, illuminated from above by an oculus, or circular aperture. Nothing could be simpler, yet no one would describe the Pantheon as a one-liner. Finished by Hadrian in the first century A.D., it is one of the most influential buildings of Western architecture, having inspired Bramante at St. Peter&#x2019;s, Christopher Wren at St. Paul&#x2019;s, and Thomas Ustick Walter at the U.S. Capitol. King&#x2019;s College Chapel of Cambridge University, begun by Henry VI in 1446, is another building whose design expresses a singular idea: a tall space whose dematerialized walls are almost entirely stained glass. Modeled on a cathedral choir, the narrow chapel is eighty feet high and almost three hundred feet long. There is no apse, no crossing, no rose window, just a numinous, soaring space. In buildings, the idea also informs the details. While the coffers of the Pantheon emphasize the solidity and weight of the dome and lead the eye up to the oculus, the lacy fan vaults of the Perpendicular Gothic chapel harmonize with the delicate tracery of the windows. <br>A more recent example of a building whose design is driven by an idea is Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Wright started with the insight that, given the high cost of Manhattan real estate, the museum had to be vertical. He explored four schemes, one of them octagonal, and settled on a spiral ramp coiling around a tall skylit space. The museumgoer would take the elevator to the top of the ramp, viewing the art as he descended. Uncomplicated in conception, yet no matter how often I go there I am always surprised&#x2014;and delighted&#x2014;anew. Wright kept the details in the background: the spiraling balustrade, for example, is a plain concrete parapet with a rounded top; the ramp floor is simply painted concrete. &#x201c;The eye encounters no abrupt change,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;but is gently led and treated as if at the edge of a shore watching an unbreaking wave.&#x201d; <br>Another modern museum that is based on a simple idea is the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, a building designed by Norman Foster in the mid-1970s. Although the building was to house a variety of uses&#x2014;exhibition spaces, a school of art history, a student cafeteria, and a faculty club&#x2014;Foster accommodated them in what was basically an extremely long shed that recalls an elegant aircraft hangar. The long space, glazed at each end, does not feel tunnel-like, thanks to the daylight that filters down from skylights. The Sainsbury Centre has no architectural antecedents, it is as if Foster had asked himself: What if many different university functions were contained in one large space? <br> <i>CONCEPT HOUSES</i> <br>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s house for Dr. Edith Farnsworth in Plano, Illinois, and Philip Johnson&#x2019;s own residence in New Canaan, Connecticut, are single spaces that ask an unusual question: What if all the walls of a house were glass? Both houses were designed as weekend retreats in the late 1940s; both are one-story boxes, the Farnsworth twenty-eight by seventy-seven feet, the Johnson thirty-two by fifty-six feet; and both are constructed of steel I-beams. A transparent house should be as open as possible, and in both cases the interior is a column-free space divided only by freestanding elements containing closets, kitchen counters, bathrooms, and other necessities. There are no conventional rooms. <br>Although Johnson finished his house first, he always credited Mies with the original idea.1 Johnson considered the German architect his model: &#x201c;I have been called Mies van der Johnson,&#x201d; he once told Yale students; &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t bother me in the slightest.&#x201d; But of his own house he said, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t say it&#x2019;s imitation Mies, because it&#x2019;s quite different.&#x201d; Johnson was not just being defensive&#x2014;Mies&#x2019;s house sits in a floodplain and is elevated five feet in the air, which makes it appear to hover, while Johnson&#x2019;s house is planted firmly on the ground. And there are other differences. While Mies uses luxurious materials&#x2014;travertine floors and tropical hardwood paneling&#x2014;Johnson uses plain red brick. The bathroom is a cylinder, &#x201c;which would of course be anathema to Mies,&#x201d; said Johnson. Mies purposely designed the exterior of his glass house to be unsymmetrical&#x2014;the roof and floor extend at one end to form a covered terrace&#x2014;while Johnson made his four fa�ades essentially identical, each with a door in the center. A final telling difference: Mies&#x2019;s steel is painted glossy white, the traditional color of garden pavilions, while Johnson&#x2019;s I-beams are matte black, making his house a machinelike presence in the natural landscape. <br>The architect and writer Peter Blake observed that Johnson&#x2019;s house is European in conception, like a small classical palazzo, while the Farnsworth House is free, light, and airy in a way that makes it more American&#x2014;despite that Mies had arrived in Chicago from Berlin only a decade earlier. Mies visited Johnson&#x2019;s glass house several times when they were working together on the Seagram Building. Johnson recounted that during his last visit, although Mies was supposed to stay overnight in the guesthouse, late in the evening he announced, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not staying here tonight. Find me another place to stay.&#x201d; Johnson said that he didn&#x2019;t know what had set Mies off, whether it was a small disagreement that they had had earlier, or whether he simply didn&#x2019;t like the architecture. <br>Philip Johnson was an art collector and his house contained two freestanding works of art: Nicolas Poussin&#x2019;s landscape painting <i>Burial of Phocion</i> and a sculpture by Elie Nadelman. Mies, on the other hand, specified that no art was to be hung on the Primavera-paneled walls. My friend Martin Pawley spent a night in the Farnsworth House and recounted that the owner, Peter Palumbo, a London developer, respected the architect&#x2019;s wishes and hung paintings (I think they were by Paul Klee) only inside the bathroom. A sign asked guests to make sure to leave the bathroom door open after showering to avoid creating condensation that would damage the art. Martin described a memorable episode that occurred during his visit. The Fox River had overflowed its banks, as it did annually, and in the morning he was greeted by the sight of the butler bringing breakfast from the nearby main house (where Palumbo stayed) in a canoe. On that occasion, the terrace did double duty as a boat dock. <br>Of the Farnsworth House, Mies&#x2019;s biographer Franz Schulze observed that it &#x201c;is more nearly a temple than a dwelling, and it rewards aesthetic contemplation before it fulfills domestic necessity.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a scholarly way of saying that a glass house is not very practical. Privacy was not the problem, since the Farnsworth House, like Johnson&#x2019;s home, is in the country, without close neighbors. Nor was the absence of separate rooms an issue, as both houses had only one occupant. The chief practical drawback of these glass houses was environmental: with unshaded plate glass and no air-conditioning, the interiors overheated in the summer, and were difficult to keep warm in the winter.2 Mies and Johnson made minimal provisions for ventilation: the Farnsworth House has two hopper windows at the bedroom end; the Johnson house has no openable windows at all, and is ventilated by opening one or more of the four doors. Since neither of the houses had insect screens, mosquitoes and flies were a problem, especially at night, when they were attracted by the light. <br>In the 1920s, Mies had designed a residence in Czechoslovakia&#x2014;the Tugendhat House&#x2014;in which large sections of a glass wall were lowered into the floor to open the living room to the outdoors, without the benefit of insect screens. Are mosquitoes, moths, and flies a lesser nuisance in Europe than in America? Perhaps, for woven-wire insect screens are an American invention that came into widespread use in the second half of the nineteenth century when the screened porch became a domestic fixture. The most elegant solution I have seen to accommodate insect screens in a modern house is in a Vero Beach, Florida, residence designed by Hugh Newell Jacobsen, in which windows and insect screens both slide out of sight into wall pockets, allowing the tall openings to be glazed, screened, or fully open. <br>There is no place for wall pockets in a glass house. Of course, Mies and Johnson could easily have installed screens but they faced an aesthetic problem: metal screens appear opaque compared with glass, which works against the sense of reflectivity that, as Mies frequently said, is a glass building&#x2019;s special quality. It is a measure of both architects&#x2019; single-mindedness&#x2014;or of their stubbornness?&#x2014;that they refused to compromise. But that&#x2019;s the nature of a strong idea: it tends to impose its own rules. The architect must either observe those rules or start over. <br>Eventually, Mies grudgingly acceded to Edith Farnsworth&#x2019;s demand to screen the covered terrace of her house. Johnson, who occupied his house for almost sixty years until his death, never installed screen doors and simply put up with the inconvenience of bugs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather sleep in Chartres Cathedral with the nearest john three blocks down the street,&#x201d; he once told a Yale class, &#x201c;than I would in a Harvard house with back-to-back bathrooms.&#x201d; Does great architecture trump practicality? Johnson&#x2019;s statement is cavalier, but his point is a serious one. The experience of great architecture is rare and precious, while convenience is commonplace&#x2014;and fungible. I live in an old stone house, designed by the Philadelphia architect H. Louis Duhring Jr. in 1907. In the last few years I have had moisture problems in one of the walls, the result of a stepped parapet that absorbs water in driving rain. The house gives me pleasure daily; the leaks require occasional patching and repainting. Life&#x2019;s imperfect. <br>Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2014;a more practical architect than his reputation suggests&#x2014;provided insect screens and screen doors in Fallingwater, the famous house that he designed for Edgar J. Kaufmann in the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania. This house was also a weekend retreat, although it is functionally more demanding than Mies&#x2019;s and Johnson&#x2019;s glass houses, since it was occupied by a family of three with frequent guests.3 Wright&#x2019;s novel idea was to situate the house on a large rock outcropping and cantilever the structure over a waterfall. He is said to have designed the house in one morning but he must have been thinking about it for a long time, as the overlapping terraces and interlocking spaces are anything but simple. The range of materials is limited&#x2014;creamy-colored reinforced concrete with rounded edges, rough stone walls and floors, and steel window frames painted his favorite color, Cherokee Red. With this simple palette, the &#x201c;old magus,&#x201d; as his biographer Brendan Gill called him, cast his spell. <br>The most famous concept house in history is an Italian Renaissance villa on the outskirts of Vicenza called the Villa Rotonda, after the circular domed room at its center&#x2014;a miniature Pantheon. Most Renaissance architects used axially symmetrical plans&#x2014;that is, if an imaginary line is drawn through the center of the house, all the rooms on the right mirror those on the left. Andrea Palladio went one step further and created <i>two</i> intersecting main axes, producing a square house with <i>four</i> identical fronts. Each front has a columned portico, and since the house is on a hilltop, each portico has a different view. Such a rigidly symmetrical plan is not as impractical as it sounds. Each of the eight rooms has direct access to the outside without interfering with whatever is going on in the domed chamber, which is the main reception room and can be reached from any of the four porticos. <br>Ever since the Villa Rotonda was built, it has been an inspiration for other architects. Vincenzo Scamozzi, Palladio&#x2019;s student who completed the villa after his master&#x2019;s death, was the first to have a go, designing the four-sided villa La Rocca on a dramatic hilltop site. The English architect Inigo Jones, who admired Palladio, designed several biaxial houses, though none was built. In the eighteenth century there were four famous Rotonda-like British houses, including one by the Scottish architect Colen Campbell, and another, Chiswick House, designed by Lord Burlington, a devout Palladian. To this day, architects have continued to be fascinated by Palladio&#x2019;s idea, and there are recent examples in the United States and England, and an exceptionally faithful facsimile that stands among olive terraces in the Palestinian West Bank. <br>Architects playing variations on old themes are similar to composers and painters inspired by their predecessors: Brahms revisiting Haydn, Liszt and Rimsky-Korsakov returning to Bach, Picasso painting versions of Goya, and both Picasso and Francis Bacon revisiting Vel�zquez. Such re-creations are a nod to genius, and also a recognition that some creative ideas&#x2014;a house with four fronts, for example&#x2014;are rich enough to merit further exploration. <br> <i>WINNING IDEAS</i> <br>To be considered for high-profile commissions, architects&#x2014;even celebrated architects&#x2014;are often required to enter competitions, in effect, beauty contests. The first American architectural competition was held in 1792, to choose a design for the President&#x2019;s House in Washington, D.C. Competition juries generally consist of architects, although they may also include a representative of the client or sponsor. In this case, the judges were the three commissioners of the new federal city and the house&#x2019;s future occupant, President George Washington. Thomas Jefferson, a recognized authority in architectural matters, took second place with a design based on the Villa Rotonda, but the winner was James Hoban, an Irish-born architect who just happened to be a prot�g� of the president. <br>There were only nine entries in the President&#x2019;s House competition, but most modern competitions have hundreds of contestants. The judging of such competitions follows a well-established pattern. The members of the jury first quickly review all the submissions, with an eye on eliminating projects that have ignored competition requirements, are incomplete, are obviously flawed, or simply look uninteresting. Once the long list is winnowed down to a manageable number, the judges spend the remainder of their time studying these designs in detail to see how well they have resolved the competition requirements. The bulk of the time may be spent discussing the final two or three submissions. Some competitions are organized in stages, a group of entrants from the first stage being chosen to elaborate their projects in a second stage. The entries to open competit...</p><h2>Teen Titans: Earth One Vol. 2</h2><p>The sequel to the NEW YORK TIMES best-selling original graphic novel is here with TEEN TITANS: EARTH ONE VOL. 2!<br><br>Picking right up after the cliffhanger ending to the first volume, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Terra and Aqualad are in desperate straits--they're homeless, destitute, and on the run from Cadmus, the project that created them.

CLUB/THE ONION</p><h2>James Cameron&#39;s Titanic</h2><p>Some jump, some fall, each dotting the water's surface like the period at the end of a sentence. Then, the stern slips under the water, plunging everyone into a coldness so intense it is indistinguishable from fire. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. The inchoate wail of 1500 souls slowly fades to individual cries from the darkness. <em>We know you can hear us! Save one life!</em> 700 survivors stand by in lifeboats built for 1200, afraid to act for fear of getting swamped. They tell themselves that the voices from the water do not belong to their husbands or their loved ones. They are merely the cries of the damned....<br>-- From <em>James Cameron's Titanic</em></p><p><i>James Cameron's Titanic</i> is a book conceived on the epic scale of the movie--not only do the massive page size and sky-high production values of the book do justice to the big ship, they give Kate Winslet's titanic hats an impact comparable to what the big screen gives them. It's also fun to get the effect of exploring a set as vast, complex, and fiscally and physically dangerous as the one Cameron created for <i>Titanic</i> the film. He is Hollywood's answer to Ahab, so he deserves a great big book.<p> Nor will fans be disappointed to hear Winslet break character--she plays an upper-class lass from the stuffiest circles--and explain how she helped her costar prepare for their first scene together, in which she stripped for her dishy portrait. "I was naked in front of Leo on the first day of shooting," says Winslet in the book. "She had no shame with it," says DiCaprio, who apparently despises shame. "She wanted to break the ice a little beforehand, so she flashed me. I wasn't prepared for that, so she had one up on me. I was pretty comfortable after that."</p><p> While the stars were getting acquainted and the wild-eyed director was figuring out historically unprecedented ways of blending live footage with computer imagery ("Cheat the size of the tugboats 10 percent smaller ... It will make the ship look even more majestic as it leaves Southampton!"), the core cast of 150 extras was taking a crash course in manners. Etiquette coach and choreographer Lynne Hockney even taught the Core (as they were called) that there was a proper way to laugh. "It was the Gilded Age, a time of the grand hostess, lavish parties and tireless pleasure-seeking," Hockney says in the book. "And each social class was scrambling to reach the one above it. This made proper behavior terribly important.... You cannot slouch in a corset, for example. You perch." One wishes there was a frame or two from the Hockney film running on a tape loop in the wardrobe building, <i>Titanic Etiquette: A Time-Traveler's Guide</i>.

The figures he casts before us-from Pancho Villa to a modern-day drug lord, from General Sherman to a skid-row Sioux named Robert Sundance-trace a story not so much of rapaciousness as of fear and loathing. Bowden twines it with the natural history of the hammer orchid, a carnivore whose deceptive delicacy comes to stand for the terror and hypocrisy that have perverted our love of the land, its peoples, and our very natures. <br></p><p><b>Charles Bowden</b> is a journalist whose work appears regularly in <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and other national publications. He is the author of several previous books of nonfiction. He lives in Tucson, Arizona.<br>Bowden is an incandescent writer attuned to beauty as well as crime and violence. He's written about drug dealers, Charles Keating, and his beloved Sonora Desert in books notable for their jolting lyricism. Here he takes us on a wild journey through his past and across the gritty American and Mexican West, ranting all the way about our poisoned earth and corrupted society. Bowden's "blood orchids" are evil, malignant blossoms that feed on nuclear waste and the horrors of war, massacre, torture, and prejudice. We have a compulsion for "killing the thing we love," Bowden claims, an urge responsible, in part, for the severe damage we've done to the environment. Bowden rails against this travesty as well as the even greater crimes perpetuated against Native Americans, but he also declares his love for the "mess" of life in the Americas, the "strange mongrel mixture of races, ideas, seeds, spores, viruses, bacteria." He despises the sanctimoniousness of the environmental movement and doesn't hesitate to declare his politically incorrect taste for alcohol, women in high heels, guns, and traveling at high speeds. As his narrative progresses, Bowden's stream of consciousness becomes a raging river, and riding it proves to be exhilarating and painful, provoking and cathartic. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Outcasts United: The Story of a Refugee Soccer Team That Changed a Town</h2><p><p><b>A moving account of how a soccer team made up of diverse refugees inspired an entire community here in the United States.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Based on the adult bestseller, <i>Outcasts United: An American Town, a Refugee Team, and One Woman's Quest to Make a Difference</i>, this young people's edition is a complex and inspirational story about the Fugees, a youth soccer team made up of diverse refugees from around the world, and their formidable female coach, Luma Mufleh. <br> &nbsp;<br> Luma Mufleh, a young Jordanian woman educated in the United States and working as a coach for private youth soccer teams in Atlanta, was out for a drive one day and ended up in Clarkston, Georgia, where she was amazed and delighted to see young boys, black and brown and white, some barefoot, playing soccer on every flat surface they could find.

He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, attended Columbia University and now lives in New York City.</p><i>Chapter One<br><br>Luma<br></i><br>The name Luma means &#x201c;dark lips,&#x201d; though Hassan and Sawsan al-Mufleh chose it for their first child less because of the shade of her lips than because they liked the sound of the name&#x2013;short, endearing, and cheerful&#x2013;in the context of both Arabic and English. The al-Mufl ehs were a wealthy, Westernized family in Amman, Jordan, a teeming city of two million, set among nineteen hills and cooled by a swirl of dry desert breezes. The family made its fortune primarily from making rebar&#x2013;the metal rods used to strengthen concrete&#x2013;which it sold across Jordan. Hassan had attended a Quaker school in Lebanon, and then college in the United States at the State University of New York in Oswego&#x2013;&#x201c;the same college as Jerry Seinfeld,&#x201d; he liked to tell people.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s mother, Sawsan, was emotional and direct, and there was never any doubt about her mood or feelings. Luma, though, took after her father, Hassan, a man who mixed unassailable toughness with a capacity to detach, a combination that seemed designed to keep his emotions hidden for fear of revealing weakness.<br><br>&#x201c;My sister and my dad don&#x2019;t like people going into them and knowing who they are,&#x201d; said Inam al-Mufl eh, Luma&#x2019;s younger sister byeleven years and now a researcher for the Jordanian army in Amman.<br><br>&#x201c;Luma&#x2019;s very sensitive but she never shows it. She doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to know where her soft spot is.&#x201d;<br><br>As a child, Luma was doted on by her family, sometimes to an extraordinary degree. At the age of three, Luma idly mentioned to her grandmother that she thought her grandparents&#x2019; new Mercedes 450 SL was &#x201c;beautiful.&#x201d; The next day, the grandparents&#x2019; driver showed up at Hassan and Sawsan al-Mufl eh&#x2019;s home with a gift: a set of keys to the Mercedes, which, they were told, now belonged to their threeyear-old daughter.<br><br>Hassan too doted on his eldest child. He had high expectations for her, and imagined her growing up to fulfi ll the prescribed role of a woman in a prominent Jordanian family. He expected her to marry, to stay close to home, and to honor her family.<br><br>From the time Luma was just a young girl, adults around her began to note her quiet confi dence, which was so pronounced that her parents occasionally found themselves at a loss.<br><br>&#x201c;When we would go to the PTA meetings,&#x201d; Hassan recalled, &#x201c;they&#x2019;d ask me, &#x2018;Why are you asking about Luma? She doesn&#x2019;t need your help.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Sometimes, Luma&#x2019;s parents found themselves striving to please their confi dent daughter, rather than the other way around. Hassan recalled that on a family vacation to Spain when Luma was ten or eleven years old, he had ordered a glass of sangria over dinner, in violation of the Muslim prohibition against drinking alcohol. When the drink arrived, Luma began to sob uncontrollably.<br><br>&#x201c;She said, &#x2018;I love my father too much&#x2013;I don&#x2019;t want him to go to hell,&#x2019; &#x201d; Hassan recalled. He asked the waitress to take the sangria away.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t drink after that,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Luma encouraged&#x2013;or perhaps demanded&#x2013;that her younger sister, Inam, cultivate self-suffi ciency, often against Inam&#x2019;s own instincts or wishes.<br><br>&#x201c;She was a tough older sister&#x2013;very tough love,&#x201d; Inam said. &#x201c;She would make me do things that I didn&#x2019;t want to do. She never wanted me to take the easy way out. And she wouldn&#x2019;t accept me crying.&#x201d;<br><br>Inam said that she has a particularly vivid memory of her older sister&#x2019;s tough love in action. The al-Mufl ehs had gathered with their cousins, as they often did on weekends, at the family farm in a rural area called Mahes, half an hour from Amman. Inam, who was just seven or eight at the time, said that Luma took her and a group of young cousins out to a dirt road to get some exercise. The kids set off jogging, with Luma trailing them in the family Range Rover. It was hot and dry and hilly, and one by one, the kids began to complain. But Luma wouldn&#x2019;t have any of it. She insisted that they keep running.<br><br>&#x201c;She was in the car, and we were running like crazy,&#x201d; Inam recalled. &#x201c;Everyone was crying. And if I would cry, she would just look at me.&#x201d;<br><br>That withering look, which Luma would perfect over the years, had the stinging effect of a riding crop. Despite the pain, little Inam kept running.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s drill-sergeant routine at Mahes became a kind of family legend, recalled to rib Hassan and Sawsan&#x2019;s firstborn for her tough exterior. The family knew another side of Luma&#x2013;one that others rarely encountered&#x2013;that of a sensitive, even sentimental young woman with a deep concern for those she perceived to be weak or defenseless. Luma laughed along with everyone else. She enjoyed a good joke and a well-earned teasing, even at her own expense. But jokes aside, Luma&#x2019;s tough love had it&#x2019;s intended effect.<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted to prove to my sister that I could do anything,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I always remember that my sister pushed me and I found out I was able to do it.&#x201d;<br><br>THE AL-MUFLEHS WERE intent on raising their children with their same cosmopolitan values. They sent Luma to the American Community School in Amman, a school for the children of American expatriates, mostly diplomats and businessmen, and elite Jordanians, including the children of King Hussein and Queen Noor. Luma learned to speak English without an accent&#x2013;she now speaks like a midwesterner&#x2013;and met kids from the United States and Europe, as well as the children of diplomats from all over the world.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s childhood was idyllic by most measures, and certainly by comparison to those of most in Jordan. She went to the best school in Amman and lived at a comfortable distance from the problems of that city, including poverty and the tensions brought on by the infl ux of Palestinian and later Iraqi refugees. But her maternal grandmother, Munawar, made a point of acknowledging and aiding the poor whenever she could. Beggars regularly knocked on her door because they knew that on principle she would always give them alms. And when relatives would tell her she was being taken advantage of because of her generosity, Munawar would brush them off.<br><br>&#x201c;She would say we had an obligation because we were so privileged,&#x201d; Luma recalled. &#x201c;And she would say, &#x2018;God judges them, not us.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Munawar&#x2019;s home abutted a lot in Amman where young men played soccer in the afternoons. As a kid, Luma would climb a grapevine on the concrete wall behind the house and watch the men play. She eventuallygot the nerve to join in, and she would play until her grandmother saw her and ordered her inside on the grounds that it was improper for a young woman to be around strange men.<br><br>&#x201c;She would have a fi t if she saw me playing soccer with men,&#x201d; Luma said. &#x201c;And then she&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;We are not going to tell your father about this.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>At the American Community School, Luma was free from the strictures of a conservative Muslim society and at liberty to play sports as boys did. She played basketball, volleyball, soccer, and baseball with the same intensity, and stood out to her coaches, particularly an African American woman named Rhonda Brown.<br><br>&#x201c;She was keen to learn,&#x201d; Brown said. &#x201c;And no matter what you asked her to do, she did it without questioning why.&#x201d; Brown, the wife of an American diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Amman, coached volleyball. She had played volleyball in college at Miami University in Ohio and, when she found herself bored in the role of a diplomat&#x2019;s wife, had volunteered to coach the women&#x2019;s varsity volleyball team at the ACS. When she showed up to coach, Brown said, she was disappointed at what she found.<br>&#x201c;These girls were lazy&#x2013;incredibly lazy,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Luma was the notable exception. Though Brown didn&#x2019;t know much about the Jordanian girl, she noticed her dedication right away and felt she was the kind of player a team could be built around. Coach Brown asked a lot of her players, and especially of Luma. She expected them to be on time to practice, to work hard, to focus, and to improve. She believed in running&#x2013;lots of running&#x2013;and drilling to the point of exhaustion. Brown challenged her players by setting an example herself. She was always on time. She was organized. When she asked her players to run fi ve kilometers, she joined them, but with a challenge: &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re younger I expect you to do it better than me,&#x201d; she told them. &#x201c;If I beat you, you can expect the worst practices ever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They ran,&#x201d; Brown said.<br><br>Brown&#x2019;s coaching philosophy was built on the belief that young people craved leadership and structure and at the same time were capable of taking on a tremendous amount of responsibility. She didn&#x2019;t believe in coddling.<br><br>&#x201c;My feeling is that kids have to have rules,&#x201d; Brown explained. &#x201c;They have to know what the boundaries are. And kids want to know what their limits are. It&#x2019;s important for them to know that people have expectations of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Brown was resigned to the fact that her players might not like her at fi rst. But she took a long view toward their development and their trust in her. She was willing to wait out the hostility until her players broke through.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m stubborn,&#x201d; Brown said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give in a lot. You can come across as mean, and until they see what kind of person you are they might not like you.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, Luma didn&#x2019;t like Brown at all. She felt singled out for extra work and didn&#x2019;t appreciate all the extra running. But she kept her mouth shut and didn&#x2019;t complain, partly, she said, out of a suspicion that she and her teammates would benefi t from the harsh treatment.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew my teammates were lazy&#x2013;talented but lazy,&#x201d; Luma said.<br><br>&#x201c;And part of me was like, Maybe I want the challenge. Maybe these very harsh, very tough practices will work.&#x201d;<br><br>Over time, the practices began to have an effect. The team improved. They were motivated, and even the slackers on the team began working hard. Along the way, Luma started to pick up on a seeming contradiction. Though she told herself she disliked Coach Brown, she wanted desperately to play well for her. &#x201c;For the majority of the time she coached me, I hated her,&#x201d; Luma said. &#x201c;But she had our respect. She didn&#x2019;t ask us to do anything she wouldn&#x2019;t do. Until then I&#x2019;d always played for me. I&#x2019;d never played for a coach.&#x201d;<br><br>When Luma was in high school and still playing for Coach Brown the junior varsity girls&#x2019; soccer team at the American Community School found itself in need of a coach. Luma volunteered. She emulated Brown&#x2013;putting the team through fi ve days a week of running drills and pushing the young women to work harder and to get better.<br><br>Luma loved it. She liked the way the daily problems of the world seemed to recede once she took the field, the subtle psychological strategies one had to employ to get the best out of each player, and most of all the sense of satisfaction that came from forging something new out of disparate elements: an entity with its distinct identity, not a collection of individuals, but a new being, a team. And she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to admit she also liked being in charge.<br><br>But as she got older and accustomed to the liberty she had as a woman at ACS&#x2013;where she could coach and play sports as she pleased&#x2013;she began to feel at odds with the Jordanian society in which she had grown up. She wanted to be able to play pickup games of soccer with whoever was around, without regard to gender. She wanted the liberty to be as assertive in her daily life as Coach Brown had taught her to be on the court. Her family&#x2019;s social status created additional pressure for her to follow a more traditional path. There were obligations, as well as the looming threat that she might be pressured into marrying someone she didn&#x2019;t love.<br><br>&#x201c;When you come from a family that&#x2019;s prominent, there are expectations of you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And I hated that. It&#x2019;s a very patriarchal society, and as modern as it is, women are still second-class citizens. I didn&#x2019;t want to be treated that way.&#x201d;<br><br>Coach Brown picked up on Luma&#x2019;s yearning. At a team sleepover, the players and coach went around the room predicting where everyone would be in ten years. Coach Brown joked that Luma would be &#x201c;living illegally in the United States.&#x201d; Everyone laughed, including Luma. But she disagreed.<br><br>&#x201c;In ten years, I&#x2019;ll be there legally,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew from even our brief time together that she wanted something else for her life,&#x201d; Brown recalled.<br><br>Toward the end of Luma&#x2019;s junior year, she and her parents decided she would attend college in the United States. Hassan and Sawsan wanted their daughter to continue her Western education, a rite of sorts for well-to-do Jordanians. But Luma was more interested in life in the United States than she was in what an education there might do for her in Jordan. &#x201c;America was the land of opportunity,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was a very appealing dream of what you want your life to be like.&#x201d; Within the family, Luma&#x2019;s grandmother alone seemed to understand the implications of her going to college in the United States.<br><br>&#x201c;If she moves to America,&#x201d; Munawar told the family, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a chance she won&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d; <br><br>Luma&#x2019;s fi rst trip to the United States came when she enrolled at Hobart and William Smith College, a coed school in the Finger Lakes region of New York, not too far from where her father had gone to college. She played soccer her first fall there, but midway through the season injured a knee, sidelining her for the rest of the year. Luma liked the school well enough, but winter there was colder than anything she had experienced in Amman, and the campus was remote. She wondered if she had made the right choice in going so far from home. Luma decided to look at other schools, and soon visited Smith College, the women&#x2019;s school in Northampton, Massachusetts.<br><br>The campus seemed to perfectly embody the setting Luma had envisioned for herself when she left Jordan for America. It was set in a picturesque New England town with a strong sense of community and security. And as a women&#x2019;s college, Smith was focused on imbuing its students with the very sort of self-reliance and self-confidence Luma felt she had been deprived of at home. Luma fell in love with the place and transferred for her sophomore year.<br><br>At Smith, Luma had what she described as a kind of awakening. She was taken by the presence of so many self-confident, achieving women, and also by the social mobility she saw evident in the student body. Her housemate, for example, was the first in her family to go to college, and there she was at one of the preeminent private colleges in the United States. That would never happen in Jordan, Luma remembered thinking to herself at the time.<br><br>Luma&#x2019;s friends at Smith remember her as outgoing and involved&#x2013;in intramural soccer and in social events sponsored by the college&#x2019;s house system. Few understood her background; she spoke English so well that other students she met assumed she was American.<br><br>&#x201c;One day we were hanging out talking about our childhoods and she said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m from Jordan,&#x2019; &#x201d; recalled Misty Wyman, a student from Maine who would become Luma&#x2019;s best friend. &#x201c;I thought she&#x2019;d been born to American parents overseas. It had never occurred to me that she was Jordanian.&#x201d;<br><br>On a trip home to Jordan after her junior year at Smith, Luma realized that she could never feel comfortable living there. Jordan, while a modern Middle Eastern state, was not an easy place for a woman used to Western freedoms. Professional opportunities for women were limited. Under Sharia law, which applied to domestic and inheritance matters, the testimony of two women carried the weight of that from a single man. A wife had to obtain permission from her husband simply to apply for a passport. And so-called honor killings were still viewed leniently in Sharia courts. As a member of a well-known family, Luma felt monitored and pressured to follow a pres...</p><h2>The Ghost Army</h2><p>Throughout the course of World War II, the Allies engaged in elaborate deceptions to help ensure the success of their troops in battle. From tanks made out of rubber to entire divisions consisting of nothing more than a few wireless operators, these heroic individuals made armies appear out of thin air and kept the German armed forces unsure where the real attack was coming from. These deceptions ranged from the North African desert to the Normandy landings, and required exceptional discipline and organisation to pull off. This book includes details of SHAEF, who organised many of the deceptions, the First US Army Group (the so-called &#39;Ghost Army&#39;), the 23rd Camouflage Engineers, and accounts of the double cross agents who risked their lives and freedom to mislead Nazi High Command. Featuring original research and interviews with veterans who participated in the deceptions, The Ghost Army brings to life the fascinating story of the men and women who made Allied success in World War II possible.</p><p></p><h2>Seabird</h2><p>The history of America at sea is presented through the travels of Seabird, a carved ivory gull.</p><p>Born in Jackson County, Michigan, in 1900, Holling Clancy Holling graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1923.

Lightning Print On Demand Title.</p><p>James Beard's 1964 classic, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i>, has been reprinted in a newly illustrated edition. This is wonderful news for all who love food and food writing. Erudite yet intimate, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i> is, first, the memoir-with-recipes of a great American gastronome. It's also fascinatingly panoramic on good meals taken worldwide; on ingredients as diverse as the potato and the truffle; on great food places, markets to restaurants; and on food people, from Beard's cantankerous, food-muse mother to many of the stars of the last century's food firmament, including Julia Child. This is not only Beard's greatest work but also one of the best books we have on food and what we know about it. <p> Beard's gastronomic life began in bounteous early-20th century Portland, Oregon, where his mother cooked for several hotels. An early culinary memory has the near-infant Beard relishing an onion, skin and all. From there the story captures a world of gastronomic likes and dislikes from "sensational" veal roasts to the gherkins known as cornichons, "one of the mistakes the French make in eating." Beard's love of French food is, however, usually unmitigated, matched only by his adoration of traditional, locally produced American cooking. Recipes for this fare, including clam souffl� and candied-ginger pumpkin pie, are among the 150 formulas offered, a Beardian cr�me de la cr�me that also encompasses hors d'oeuvres, breads, and cakes. The book also chronicles Beard's ascent to fame, beginning with his 1940s appearance on <i>I Love to Eat</i>, TV's first cooking show, to the arrival of his many influential cookbooks. It ends, characteristically, in his kitchen, "the place where [he] can best satisfy the eccentricities of [his] own palate." The journey makes am enthralling read. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>James Beard</b> had a national reputation as an authority on every phase of food. Consultant to a wine and spirits establishment, he wrote seventy-six other books and numerous articles for national magazines on widely varied phases of cooking. Mr. Beard, who knew the cooking of every corner of our country, cooked in nearly every language. He lived abroad, traveled throughout Europe a number of times, saw most of the Western Hemisphere, and visited Hawaii and North Africa. His familiarity with exotic foreign foods spiced his extensive knowledge of American cooking at its best.<p>Mr. Beard was adviser to several large food companies, was food editor of Argosy magazine, and made many appearances on radio and television. His first three books are <i>Hors d'Oeuvres and Canapes, Cook It Outdoors,</i> and <i>Fowl and Game Cookery.</i> Equally at home in the kitchen of his own New York apartment and that of a hotel, James Beard brought the same sure touch to a half-hour supper as he did to the most elaborate buffet.

He lives in Kingston, Jamaica.Chapter One<br>COLUMBUS AND JAMAICA'S<br>CHOSEN PEOPLE<br>May 1504, Santa Gloria, Jamaica: For nearly a year, Columbus had been stranded in Jamaica with a hoard of gold, a mutinous crew, and a few dozen teenage loyalists, some of whom were secret Jews. Alone, melancholy, and confined to his cabin by gout, the great explorer wrote his patron Queen Isabella a despairing letter. He feared that even if he defeated the mutineers, the governor of Santo Domingo, who had promised to send a rescue ship, wanted him dead.<br><br>So much had happened since he had been making the rounds of Europe, a would-be explorer going from king to king seeking royal backing for a promised quick passage west across the Ocean Sea to India and the wealth of the East. In 1486, at his first meeting with Spain's royal couple, King Ferdinand, although intrigued by the plan, told Columbus the time was not opportune. They were in the midst of a war and could not seriously consider such an important matter until peace was restored. In parting, Queen Isabella counseled patience and awarded Columbus a retainer, promising they would meet again when the war was over.<br><br>On January 12, 1492, Columbus entered the royal quarters. He had been summoned a few days after Spain's final victory over the Moors at Granada, and the queen had sent him money to buy new clothes and a mule to ride. Encouraged by her gift, Columbus was confident. He had honed his proposal into a detailed presentation, with maps and charts from the Jewish astronomer Abraham Zacuto, and quotes from the Bible and Greek sages supporting his view that the world was round, the oceans not large, and Japan lay three thousand miles to the west, across the Ocean Sea. Prepared for questions, he received none.<br><br>After an unsettling silence, Ferdinand spoke. Victory over the Moors had emptied the treasury, he said. Moreover, he could not abide Columbus's demand for hereditary rule over lands he might discover. The queen, his admirer, said nothing. The meeting broke up and Columbus left, angry and disgusted. All this time he had waited for the war to end. Now that it had, Ferdinand was pleading poverty. Pausing briefly in the corridor, he informed the king's treasurer that he was leaving for France where Bartholomew, his younger brother, was arranging an audience with the king. If that monarch wasn't interested, he would cross the channel to meet with the English king. He would not be denied his dream, one that, as Cervantes wrote of Don Quixote, "He hugged and would not part with even if barefoot friars had begged him."<br><br>Before Columbus rode past the gates of Santa Fe, the royal treasurer, Luis de Santangel, sought and was granted an audience with Queen Isabella. The royal chronicler noted, "[Santangel] appeared distressed as if a great misfortune had befallen him personally." He had good reason: Santangel was a secret Jew, and as a member of the royal court, he was aware his people were about to be expelled from Spain. There were upward of a half million Jews in the country they had called home since the time of Christ. Where would they go? India? China? Perhaps the explorer Columbus would discover a new land somewhere. Santangel and other secret Jews in the royal service hoped Columbus's voyage would provide an answer.<br><br>The Inquisition mandated that Jews, under penalty of death, must either leave or convert to Catholicism. Santangel, like many others, had converted and became a New Christian. If discovered Judaizing, the converts were liable to be burned at the stake. The Santangel family, long established in Spain, was among the first targets of the Inquisition. Luis's cousins had gone up in flames in Saragossa, and only the intervention of Ferdinand had prevented Luis from suffering the same fate.<br><br>Santangel addressed the queen. He was astonished, he told her, "to see Her Highness who has always shown such resolute spirit in matters of great consequence, should lack it now for an enterprise of so little risk for so vast a gain." He spoke to the queen of the wealth to be acquired, and the great service she would render to God, "all for the price of a few caravels [ships]." Alluding to Columbus's plan to seek royal backing elsewhere, he cautioned Isabella, "It would be a great damage to Her Crown and a grave reproach to Her Highness if any other prince should undertake what Columbus offered Her Highness." If money was a consideration, Santangel said, he would be glad to finance the fleet himself.<br><br>A mounted messenger caught up with Columbus as he was crossing the Bridge of the Pines, seven miles from Santa Fe, and bade him return. Later that day, with all parties again gathered in the royal quarters, the king informed Columbus that the Crown would sponsor his Enterprise of the Indies, and meet his demands. No mention was made of hereditary title. Two months later, it was still a stumbling block in his negotiations when an event occurred that made its inclusion mandatory.<br><br>On the morning of March 31, 1492, Columbus was in his room in Santa Fe overlooking the main square when the sound of trumpets brought him to his balcony. Below, the town crier, flanked by mounted guards, read the expulsion order of the Inquisition: Jews had four months to leave. After that, any "caught in Our domains will be punished without trial by death, and seizure of property." <br><br>The Jews of Spain had been threatened with expulsion before. Rulers since the Visigoths had used this threat to extract more money from them. A period joke compared the Jews to a "money box" that you break open when you need money. But this time it was different: The Church was involved.<br>To the Jews of the royal court who supported Columbus, the expulsion order made it essential that Columbus hold out for hereditary rule. If no Asian kingdom welcomed Jewish refugees, Columbus, as the ruler of a new land, would be able to provide a haven for Spanish Jews.<br><br>It is thought that Columbus himself was a descendant of Spanish Jews, the Colon family, who had converted and moved to Genoa a century before on the heels of the Massacre of 1391. Some even contend he was a Cabalist. Whatever his genealogy, he was in sympathy with the People of the Book, and they with him. In his early years, in Portugal and Spain, he lived in a largely Jewish and New Christian world of navigators, cartographers, astronomers, and mathematicians. While others looked askance at this wandering sailor and laughed at his dream, Iberian Jews and conversos assisted Columbus in developing his Enterprise of the Indies. In their learned circles, they dealt with a round world. Church geography did not apply to them.<br><br>On April 17, Columbus agreed to the Capitulations of Santa Fe, which limited his rights to lifetime rule. Two weeks later, this ruling was reversed, and Columbus was granted hereditary rule. No account exists of the final negotiations, but it is likely that court Jews, facing the forced exile of their people, counseled Columbus to hold firm to his demand. One imagines a scene in the royal chambers with Santangel persuading the royals that the explorer's demand should not trouble them. If his voyage were successful, Columbus and his crew of ninety men could not possibly subdue one of the powerful Asian nations. On the other hand, if he took possession of a few islands along the way, the Crown would benefit by having way stations for Spain's trading ships plying the shortcut passage to the wealth of the East.<br><br>Whether or not such a scene took place, Ferdinand finally relented: Columbus would sail with his right to rule any new lands he discovered, to be "enjoyed forever by his heirs and successors."<br>After Columbus returned from his successful first voyage, he made three more trips across the Western Sea. He never reached Asia, and didn't live long enough to fulfill his pledge to Santangel and the court Jews to provide a homeland for converted Jews. But it would be kept by his family in the "new land" the Crown did bequeath to Columbus's descendants, the island of Jamaica. How this came about goes back to a promise he made to the teenage conversos who stood by him when he was marooned there.<br><br>Returning from his fourth voyage to the New World, Columbus had been forced to beach his ships in Jamaica after sailing from Panama with a cache of gold objects bartered from the Indians. His two ships were leaking badly. Columbus hoped to reach Santo Domingo to obtain others to return to Spain. But his worm-eaten caravels, described by his son as "more full of holes than a bees' honeycomb," barely made Jamaica. With water rising in their holds, he ran them aground and lashed them together in a shallow, becalmed bay on the island's north coast, "a cross bow's shot from land." Atop his foredeck he fashioned a palm thatch hut to serve as his cabin.<br><br>In his first letter to the queen, written soon after he arrived, he bragged that he had discovered the source of Solomon's gold in the mines of Panama, and claimed to have seen more gold in a few days there than in all his previous trips. His fourteen-year-old son Fernando, brought along as cabin boy, later recorded that his father had traded small bells and mirrors for sixty-three gold pendants and other gold objects with the Veragua Indians of Panama.<br><br>This was his second trip to Jamaica. When he had discovered the island in 1494, he had named the half-moon bay where he was now stranded Santa Gloria for "the beauty of its glorious landscape." After a year, he thought he might never leave. Was this where his life was to end? Uncertain of his future, he wrote his queen:<br>We have been confined 10 months, lodged on the decks of our ships. My men have mutinied. My brother, my son, and those that are faithful are sick, starving and dying. Governor Ovando of Santo Domingo has sent to see if I am dead rather than to carry me back alive.

Can the proud and willful Horace Dinsmore learn to love his only child---a little girl whose first allegiance is to God? Introducing soft cover editions in the Elsie Dinsmore Series with newly designed covers.</p><p>For girls ages 10-14 ? About 100 years ago, a bright-eyed little girl named Elsie Dinsmore stole the hearts of parents and children around the world. In 28 novels published between 1868 and 1904, Elsie exemplified true biblical faith in the face of adversity--inspiring generations of girls and young women. Now Elsie&#39;s story comes to life again in a completely updated series adapted from the original novels. While faithful to Martha Finley&#39;s stories and characters, these adaptations also meet the needs and interests of contemporary young readers. We first meet Elsie when she is eight years old and living on her grandfather&#39;s plantation in the South. In succeeding novels, she grows up, finds love, marries and has her own children, and eventually becomes a grandmother. Throughout her life, Elsie faces each new challenge--from personal temptations to the tragedies of war and the loss of loved ones--with strength, courage, and trust in the love and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Zondervan is pleased to offer the first four volumes of this timeless series. Although set in a distant time and place, they are as lively, engaging, and relevant as the best of modern Christian juvenile fiction. The Elsie Dinsmore series promises to provide inspiration and encouragement to a new generation of girls.Martha Finley (1828 - 1909) was a remarkable woman whose quiet Christian life has influenced many. A teacher by profession, her writing career began wih Sunday school stories for children. In 1868, her novel Elsie Dinsmore was published and became the publisher&#39;s best-selling book that year, spawning a series that sold millions of copies at home and abroad. The Millie books were a follow-up to that series.</p><h2>Vampirates: Black Heart (Vampirates, 4)</h2><p><br> There's a new ship of vampirates roaming the seas, leaving a trail of fear and devastation in its wake.

There are two types of essential fatty acids (EFAs), omega-6 and omega-3. The problem with our modern diet is that it contains far more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3s. This hidden imbalance makes us more vulnerable to heart disease, cancer, obesity, autoimmmune diseases, allergies, diabetes, and depression. </p><p> The Omega Diet is a natural, time-tested diet that balances the essential fatty acids in your diet. It is packed with delicious food that contain the "good" fats, including real salad dressing, cheese, eggs, fish--even the occasional chocolate dessert--and an abundance of antioxidant-rich fruits, vegetables, and legumes. </p><p> <i>The Omega Diet</i> provides: </p><p></p><ul><li> seven simple dietary guidelines for optimal physical and mental health <p></p></li><li> a concise guide to the foods you need to restore your body's nutritional balance <p></p></li><li> a diet plan that lets you eat fat as you lose fat <p></p></li><li> fifty delicious recipes that are quick and easy to prepare <p></p></li><li> a comprehensive three-week menu to help you get started</li></ul></p><p>Is it really possible that eating more fat is the key to better health? It depends on the fat, according to Dr. Artemis Simopoulos. <i>The Omega Plan</i> shows, in great detail, the difference between omega-3 fats, those found in fish and some green vegetables, and omega-6 fats, which are found in most meats and vegetable oils. The former have heart-protective and cancer-preventive properties; the latter, she writes, cause obesity, heart disease, cancer, depression, and a host of other ills. Omega-3 fats are at the heart of her plan, along with ample servings of fruits and vegetables. Unlike diets based on deprivation, Simopoulos offers some fairly lush food choices, including an ounce of cheese every day. Best of all, <i>The Omega Plan</i> is bursting with so much useful information about food shopping and preparation that you'll be able to use its advice the second you put the book down.Artemis Simopoulos, M.D., is a world authority on essential fatty acids and was nutritional adviser to the Office of Consumer Affairs at the White House.

By and large our cities lack comfort and grace. Oh, they have their bright spots &#x2014; and there is lots of good work being done &#x2014; but overall it's pretty dreary. <p> The 'theory' of this book is that we don't pay attention to the small details of cities that really make the difference in our comfort. We spend a lot of time planning, a lot of time thinking about how wonderful it could all be. But we don't spend a whole lot of effort dealing with the thousands of small details that make up our daily experience. We are great on large-scale strategy and a bit inept at tactics. </p><p> There are many people all across the world who see both the poverty of our urban environments and see a way to evolve out of it. Speaking loosely, this approach can be called 'the new urbanism.' (I say loosely because there are many threads to this emerging urban tapestry and some pull in different directions. But they are all tied together by the desire to create cities built to human scale, where people can walk and where there is a sense of community.) </p><p> The simple patterns and simple details shown in City Comforts are not any panacea but they provide a framework for judging new construction, for separating the simple but crucial patterns from the trivial matters of style. This simple framework asks us to examine a very few elements of the urban landscape but it will go a long way to improve our cities.</p>David Sucher has been active in urban planning and real estate development in Seattle for the past 25 years.

But how might we get to the heart of this work today, 2,500 years after its original composition? Alain Badiou breathes life into Plato's landmark text and revives its universality. Rather than producing yet another critical commentary, he has instead worked closely on the original Greek and, through spectacular changes, adapted it to our times. In this innovative reimagining of Plato's work, Badiou has removed all references specific to ancient Greek society&#x2015;from lengthy exchanges about moral courage in archaic poetry to political considerations mainly of interest to the aristocratic elite&#x2015;and has expanded the range of cultural references. Here, philosophy is firing on all cylinders: Socrates and his companions are joined by Beckett, Pessoa, Freud, and Hegel, among others. Together these thinkers demonstrate that true philosophy endures, ready to absorb new horizons without changing its essence.<br><br>Moreover, Badiou&#x2015;who is also a dramatist&#x2015;has transformed the Socratic dialogue into a genuine oratorial contest. In his version of the <i>Republic</i>, the interlocutors do much more than simply agree with Socrates. They argue, stand up to him, put him on the spot, and show thought in motion. In this work of dramatic scholarship and philosophy, we encounter a modern version of Plato's text that is alive, stimulating, and directly relevant to our own world.</p><p>In this innovative reimagining of Plato's <i>Republic</i>, one of philosophy's best known texts, Alain Badiou removes all references specific to ancient Greek society and modernizes the work's cultural ties.

I appreciate your passion for books and for stories, your intense and thoughtful conversations, and the comments you have sent to me from across the country and across the world. </p> <p> Now, I&#x2019;m really pleased and excited to introduce you to my new novel, <i>The Lake of Dreams.</i> Set in the beautiful Finger Lakes area of upstate New York, this novel is the story of Lucy Jarrett and her discovery of a hidden past, glimpsed first through fragments of old letters and traces left in stained glass windows. Lucy&#x2019;s quest through the artifacts of history brings her face to face with the dynamics she fled the summer after her father drowned; it compels her to make an inward journey, too, one that will alter her understanding of herself and change the course of her life. </p> <p> <i>The Lake of Dreams</i> is a book I&#x2019;ve been imagining for a long time. Years ago I wrote a 400 page draft of a different novel that had some of these same thematic concerns, including a complex family history, the importance of the land, and the comet connecting generations. That early novel ended up in a box in my basement, as so many first novels do, though I did return to it from time to time, and once I even made it 200 pages into another version before I put it aside again. Meanwhile, I finished my story collection, <i>The Secrets of a Fire King</i>. I wrote <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i>. </p> <p> Yet the essence of the earlier story persisted, and shortly after <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i> was finished, but before it was published, I started writing <i>The Lake of Dreams</i>. Those earlier, discarded drafts had finally brought me to the heart of the story, and this time I had the voice, which is always the crucial discovery. Then the characters from the past began to emerge, with all their fascinating revelations.

For a golden decade following World War II, jazz talent and musical activity flourished in Portland. A thriving African American neighborhood--that would soon be bulldozed for urban renewal--spawned a jazz heyday rarely rivaled on the West Coast. Such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Wardell Gray headlined Portland clubs and traded chops with the up-and-coming local talent. The Dude Ranch. Lil&#39; Sandy&#39;s McClendon&#39;s Rhythm Room. The Frat Hall. The Chicken Coop. The Uptown Ballroom. Jazz historian Bob Dietsche leads a guided tour of the main jazz spots--from supper club to dance hall--capturing the emotion, excitement, and energy of an evening on the town. His book for the first time collects hundreds of pieces of local jazz history--photographs, personal recollections, reviews, maps, handbills--to create &#34;an anatomy of a jazz village.&#34; Dietsche&#39;s compendium of stories and moments brings to life the citizens of the jazz village--the musicians and dancers, the disc jockeys and promoters, the critics and music teachers, the club owners and patrons. Jumptown celebrates and preserves this rich cultural past and showcases its continuing influence. In an afterword, Lynn Darroch recaps the highlights in Portland jazz since 1968 and shows how &#34;Portland&#39;s twenty-first-century jazz scene reflects the city&#39;s original golden age, and the spirit of the Avenue remains in the sounds of today.&#34;</p><p>Robert Dietsche has taught courses in jazz history at Oregon colleges and universities and was the longtime host of "Jazzville" on Oregon Public Broadcasting radio. He is the founder and former owner of Django Records, Portland&#x2019;s legendary used-record store. His writings about jazz have appeared in numerous publications, including Jazz Journal, The Oregonian, Willamette Week, Pittsburgh Press, and the Toledo Blade. <p>Jim Swenson is an independent film director in Portland. </p><p>Lynn Darroch is a Portland writer and editor. His articles about jazz and culture often appear in The Oregonian.</p>&#34;Action central was Williams Avenue, an entertainment strip lined with hot spots where you could find jazz twenty-four hours a day.... You could stand in the middle of the Avenue (where the Blazers play basketball today) and look up Williams past the chili parlors, past the barbecue joints, the beauty salons, all the was to Broadway, and see hundreds of people dressed up as if they were going to a fashion show. It could be four in the morning. It didn&#39;t matter; this was one of those &#39;streets that never slept.&#39;&#34;</p><h2>Mrs Dalloway (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>WITH INTRODUCTIONS BY VALENTINE CUNNINGHAM AND CAROL ANN DUFFY<br><br>In this vivid portrait of one day in a woman's life, Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party she is to give that evening. As she readies her house she is flooded with memories and re-examines the choices she has made over the course of her life.</p><p>Clarissa Dalloway is civilised--without the ostentation of a socialite, but with enough distinction to attract them to her parties. She finds excess offensive, but surrounds herself with the highest quality and has an abhorrence for anything ugly or awkward. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is as much a character study as it is a commentary on the ills and benefits society gleans from class. Through Virginia Woolf, we spend a day with Clarissa as she interacts with servants, her children, her husband, and even an ex-lover. As she plans and executes one of her celebrated parties, she reveals inner machinations incongruous with her class-defined behaviors, that ultimately enable her to transcend them."<i>Mrs Dalloway</i> contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century" (Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours)<br><br>"A beautiful piece of writing" (Will Self <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>"I think <i>To The Lighthouse</i> and <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> are sheer magic" (Eileen Atkins <i>Daily Express</i>)<br><br>"Virginia Woolf was one of the great innovators of that decade of literary Modernism, the 1920s. Novels such as <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> and <i>To the Lighthouse</i> showed how experimental writing could reshape our sense of ordinary life. Taking unremarkable materials - preparations for a genteel party, a day on a bourgeois family holiday - they trace the flow of associations and ideas that we call "consciousness"."

To stagger together through today's column about grammatical possessiveness, you and I must agree on the difference between a gerund and a participle. </p><p> Take the word <i>dancing</i>. It starts out as a form of a verb: "Look, Ma, I'm <i>dancing!</i>" When that word is used as an adjective to modify a noun -- "look at that dancing bear!" -- it's called a participle. </p><p> But when the same word is used as a noun -- "I see the bear, and its <i>dancing</i> isn't so hot" -- then the word is classified as a gerund. (From the Latin <i>gerundum</i>, rooted in <i>gerere</i>, "to bear, to carry," because the gerund, though a noun, seems to bear the action of a verb.) </p><p> We give the same word these different names to tell us what it's doing and what its grammatical needs are. Two great grammarians had a titanic spat in the 1920s over the use of the possessive in this sentence: "Women having the vote reduces men's political power." H. W. Fowler derided what he called "the fused participle" as "grammatically indefensible" and said it should be "Women's having"; Otto Jespersen cited famous usages, urged dropping the possessive and called Fowler a "grammatical moralizer." </p><p> Comes now Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with the latest manifestation of this struggle. An Associated Press account of his stinging dissent in <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> in which the Court struck down that state's anti-sodomy law, quoted Scalia out of context as writing, "I have nothing against homosexuals," which seemed condescending. His entire sentence, though, was not: "I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means." </p><p> Note the lack of apostrophes after <i>homosexuals</i> and <i>group</i> to indicate possession; Fowler would have condemned that as a "fused participle." Such loosey-goosey usage from the conservative Scalia, of all people? </p><p> "When I composed the passage in question," the justice informs me, "I pondered for some time whether I should be perfectly grammatical and write 'I have nothing against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting their agenda,' etc. The object of the preposition 'against,' after all, is not 'homosexuals <i>who are</i> promoting,' but rather 'the promoting <i>of</i> (in the sense of <i>by</i>) homosexuals.' </p><p> "I have tried to be rigorously consistent in using the possessive before the participle," Scalia notes, "when it is the action, rather than the actor, that is the object of the verb or preposition (or, for that matter, the subject of the sentence)." </p><p> But what about his passage in <i>Lawrence</i>, in which he failed to follow Fowler and fused the participle? </p><p> "I concluded that because of the intervening phrase 'or any other group,' writing 'homosexuals' " -- with the apostrophe indicating possession -- "(and hence 'any other group's') would violate what is perhaps the first rule of English usage: that no construction should call attention to its own grammatical correctness. Finding no other formulation that could make the point in quite the way I wanted, I decided to be ungrammatical instead of pedantic." </p><p> But his attempt to be a regular guy backfired. In a jocular tone, Scalia observes: "God -- whom I believe to be a strict grammarian as well as an Englishman -- has punished me. The misquotation would have been more difficult to engineer had there been an apostrophe after 'homosexuals.' I am convinced that in this instance the AP has been (unwittingly, I am sure) the <i>flagellum Dei</i> to recall me from my populist, illiterate wandering. (You will note that I did not say 'from me wandering.')" </p><p> <i>My</i> does beat <i>me</i> before that gerund <i>wandering</i>. Robert Burchfield, editor of the third edition of <i>Fowler's Modern English Usage,</i> writes, "The possessive with gerund is on the retreat, but its use with proper names and personal nouns and pronouns persists in good writing." </p><p> Now let's parse Scalia's self-parsing. In his refusal to say "from me wandering," <i>wandering</i> is a gerund. When a personal pronoun comes in front of a gerund, the possessive form is called for: say <i>my</i>, not <i>me</i>. This avoidance of a fused participle makes sense: you say about the above-mentioned bear "I like <i>his</i> dancing," not "I like <i>him</i> dancing," because you want to stress not the bear but his action in prancing about. </p><p> In Scalia's dissent in the Texas sodomy case, <i>promoting</i> is a gerund, the object of the preposition <i>against</i>. His strict-construction alternative, using apostrophes to indicate possession -- "against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting" -- is correct but clunky. He was right to avoid it, and is wrong to castigate himself for eschewing clunkiness. </p><p> There would have been another choice, however: put the gerund ahead of the possessors. Try this: "I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means." That would not only avoid the confusing apostrophes, but follows "I have nothing against" with its true object, the gerund <i>promoting</i> -- and would make it impossible for any reporter to pull out a condescending "I have nothing against homosexuals." </p><p><br> <i>Regarding your proposed solution to my gerundial problem (to wit, "I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means"): It is so obvious that of course I considered it. Two problems. (1) I do not like to have a relative pronoun preceding its antecedent, as in "the promoting of </i>their<i> agenda by homosexuals." (2) More importantly, English remains a language in which emphasis is largely conveyed by word order, and the emphasis in my sentence was upon </i>homosexuals'<i> promoting, not upon (where your alternative places it) the</i> promoting <i>by homosexuals. Surely you can sense the difference.</i> </p><p> Justice Antonin Scalia<br> Supreme Court of the United States<br> Washington, D.C. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by The Cobbett Corporation</p></p><h2>Illustrated Guide Gardening</h2><p>Providing guidance on a wide range of garden types from small backyard plots to country acreage, an in-depth reference offers straightforward information on such topics as plants, pest-control, fertilizer, and environmental awareness.</p><p>Updated from the 1978 original.

Michener brings the dramatic questions of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x2019;s beloved musical South Pacific to a new generation in this gloriously illustrated book. &#x201c;If your library needs a retelling of South Pacific, illustrated with glowing, verdant art that re-creates a jungle island, this is most emphatically it.&#x201d;-Booklist<br></p><p>No BioGrade 3-6-- Michener has done himself, Rogers and Hammerstein, and children no favor by ``simplifying'' his own stories. The musical is based on two of the stories in Tales of the South Pacific (Macmillan, 1944), Michener's honest, gritty portrayal of life on the islands during World War II. Complex and adult, these intense stories succeeded in the musical format because the melodic and poetic line of song can convey that which cannot be baldly shown or stated. In this re-writing, Michener has ``novelized'' the playscript, even incorporating the phrase ``across a crowded room'' when describing the enchanted evening. The themes of love, racism, and war are too big to be watered down and this attempt just muddies a good story and might well cause a generation of confused readers to stay away from the play or movie. Except that probably very few will read it. Hague is a dependable draughtsman. However, in this book, he evokes a feeling of badly re-created '40s magazine illustrations. The result is odd and off-putting. While the island views, full of color and sunlight, set a lovely scene, the people's faces are unappealing and create no pull for their story. This is a peculiar choice for a picture book. Let's hope neither of these good craftsmen is judged by it.<br><i>- Sally T.

In January 1947 Simone de Beauvoir landed at La Guardia airport and began a four-month journey that took her from one coast of the United States to the other, and back again. Embraced by the Cond� Nast set in a swirl of cocktail parties in New York, where she was hailed as the "prettiest existentialist" by Janet Flanner in <i>The New Yorker</i>, de Beauvoir traveled west by car, train, and Greyhound, immersing herself in the nation's culture, customs, people, and landscape. The detailed diary she kept of her trip became <i>America Day by Day,</i> published in France in 1948 and offered here in a completely new translation. It is one of the most intimate, warm, and compulsively readable texts from the great writer's pen.<br><br>Fascinating passages are devoted to Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and San Antonio. We see de Beauvoir gambling in a Reno casino, smoking her first marijuana cigarette in the Plaza Hotel, donning raingear to view Niagara Falls, lecturing at Vassar College, and learning firsthand about the Chicago underworld of morphine addicts and petty thieves with her lover Nelson Algren as her guide. This fresh, faithful translation superbly captures the essence of Simone de Beauvoir's distinctive voice. It demonstrates once again why she is one of the most profound, original, and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century.<br><br><b>On New York:</b>"I walk between the steep cliffs at the bottom of a canyon where no sun penetrates: it's permeated by a salt smell.

Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret life?<br></p><p>With five novels to her credit, including the acclaimed <i>The Weight of Water</i>, Anita Shreve now offers a skillfully crafted exploration of the long reach of tragedy in <i>The Pilot's Wife</i>. News of Jack Lyons's fatal crash sends his wife into shock and emotional numbness: "Kathryn wished she could manage a coma. Instead, it seemed that quite the opposite had happened: She felt herself to be inside of a private weather system, one in which she was continuously tossed and buffeted by bits of news and information, sometimes chilled by thoughts of what lay immediately ahead, thawed by the kindness of others ... frequently drenched by memories that seemed to have no regard for circumstance or place, and then subjected to the nearly intolerable heat of reporters, photographers and curious on-lookers. It was a weather system with no logic, she had decided, no pattern, no progression, no form." The situation becomes even more dire when the plane's black box is recovered, pinning responsibility for the crash on Jack. In an attempt to clear his name, Kathryn searches for any and all clues to the hours before the flight. Yet each discovery forces her to realize that she didn't know her husband of 16 years at all. Shreve's complex and highly convincing treatment of Kathryn's dilemma, coupled with intriguing minor characters and an expertly paced plot, makes <i>The Pilot's Wife</i> really take off.8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Designing Handmade Rugs: Inspiration for Hooked, Punched, and Prodded Projects</h2><p><li>How to use color, shape, texture, borders, and other design elements creatively in all kinds of hooked, needle-punched, and prodded rugs</li><li>Advice for gathering inspiration from the world and translating it into a rug design</li><li>How to choose durable, eco-friendly materials and dyes</li><li>Ideas for creating art together through rug making workshops and parties</li><li>Includes instructions and patterns for 11 rugs, pillows, and handbags</li></p><p>Annie Sherburne is a hooked rug artist who lives in England.</p><h2>Death of a Ghost (Hamish Macbeth)</h2><p><p>There are many ruined castles in Scotland.

A glass of lightly chilled mead on a summer&#39;s evening is a splendid delight. And yet, of all the crafts of mankind, mead-making is certainly one of the oldest. It is likely that mead was made even before the wheel was invented as stone-age cave paintings depict the collection of honey from bee colonies. The drink made from honey became a staple of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Medieval and Renaissance Britain. This practical book will inspire you to take up this admirable craft. It includes chapters on honey selection, mead-making techniques, and forty-two recipes for mead, melomel (using honey mixed with fruit juice), pyment (honey mixed with grapes), hippocras (honey mixed with grapes and herbs), metheglin (spiced medicinal mead), cyser (honey mixed with apples) and other honey drinks.</p><p>Peter M.

It&#x2019;s riveting and tremendous fun, but it would be wrong to call it a romp &#x2013; it&#x2019;s moving and profound, and in the end it&#x2019;s about trying to find some kind of life in this world.

She lives in Dallas, Texas.</p>BOOTLEG (Chapter 1)The Little Sheppard <p>LOOKING BACK on the childhood of Morris Sheppard, you can see glimmers of a budding statesman, the kind of earnest political leader who would want to make a big difference in the world.</p> <p>Born in 1875, little Morris learned poetry and literary passages before he was old enough to recognize his ABCs. As a toddler, he would stand on the counter of a local store in rural East Texas and recite verses for a stick of candy, continuing until his pockets couldn't hold another piece.</p> <p>Attending schools in small Texas towns like Daingerfield, Black Jack, and Pittsburg, he studied Greek, Latin, history, and English and developed persuasive skills and an apparent flair for leadership. At 13, he shared with some other boys the story of William Tell, the legendary marksman who shot an apple off his son's head with a bow and arrow. Admiring Tell's skill and bravery, but lacking the arrows, Morris and his friends decided to reenact the deed--with a gun.</p> <p>"We are told," reported the Pittsburg Press in 1888, "that several boys stood with apples on their heads and Morris with a target rifle shot them off--that is to say, the apples, fortunately not their heads."</p> <p>The boys' parents were horrified when they heard about the game and put a quick end to it. Morris escaped a whipping but got a stern lecture from his father, a local judge.</p> <p>When Morris finished his regular schooling at 16, he moved on to the University of Texas in Austin. Jumping into student life at the young and still-small school, he joined a fraternity, led a literary society, played the cornet and piano, and sang in the glee club. Always fond of a good joke, he got a kick out of entering the dining hall by walking on his hands. But he was best known for his preacherlike speaking skills and was selected to compete in contests and serve as a graduation speaker.</p> <p>From there he went to law school, spending two years in Austin and a third at Yale University in Connecticut. Once again, he attracted attention as a star orator, winning a debating prize and speaking at the graduation ceremonies.</p> <p>Somewhere between his general-store recitations and his law degree, young Morris came to a heartfelt belief: He despised liquor and the saloons that sold it. He sometimes said his feelings grew out of his grammar school science classes, where he saw vivid drawings of a drunkard's stomach and read about how alcohol destroyed the human body.</p> <p>He may have been influenced by the anti-liquor stance of the Methodist church, which he joined as a college student. His time at Yale also may have hardened his stance. He arrived there in debt and driven to succeed. So, he said, "I cut out every item of expense that was possible and quit every practice which might be injurious"--including tobacco, coffee, and tea. The result, he said, was "so satisfactory" that those items "remained on the contraband list ever since."</p> <p>After Yale, young Morris began practicing law in East Texas, but in 1902, his career took an unexpected turn. His father, John, who had been elected to a second term in the U.S. House of Representatives, fell ill and then passed away. Friends immediately urged Morris to run for his father's seat.</p> <p>By the mid-1920s, when he posed with two youngsters in front of the Capitol, Sheppard was a senior statesman in Congress.</p> <p>Jumping in just ten days before the primary election, Morris stumped the district, delivering an average of seven speeches a day. When his opponents made fun of his youth, he replied that it was something he "was overcoming day by day."</p> <p>To nearly everyone's surprise, he won the seat. At the age of twenty-seven, he headed to Washington.</p> <p>Small in stature at 5 feet, 7 inches, slight at 135 pounds, and youthful looking, Sheppard hardly looked like a Congressman. "It will take the older members some time to get to know Mr. Sheppard, so that they will not try to send him on errands," the Washington Post noted.</p> <p>While most known for his glittery speeches, Sheppard (center, seated) also chaired a U.S. House Public Buildings and Grounds Committee in 1912.</p> <p>Nicknamed the "boy orator of Texas," Sheppard was originally known more for his speaking skills than for any special legislation. As the "boy" matured into a confident congressman, the world outside of Washington was changing. Debates that had simmered for years over whether alcohol was dangerous and should be legally banned were beginning to roll to a boil. Originally, the arguments took place community by community and county by county. But as the number of towns outlawing liquor sales and saloons multiplied, the organizers raised the ante, taking aim at entire states. To support their efforts, Sheppard introduced legislation to keep liquor from moving from wet areas--where liquor was legal--into dry ones, where liquor was outlawed.</p> <p>In 1911, he actively campaigned to prohibit the sale of alcohol throughout Texas, openly supporting prohibition for the first time. Despite his efforts, the prohibition proposal fell a few thousand votes short in the hotly contested election.</p> <p>In 1913, one of Texas's U.S. senators resigned. Sheppard outmaneuvered a more popular candidate, and the Texas legislature selected him to fill the powerful job as senator. In a colorful speech to the state legislature, he accepted his new job, calling for limits on working hours, clearer and simpler laws, and, with fiery eloquence, an end to liquor sales.</p> <p>"The liquor traffic is a peril to society," he said. "I shall oppose this scourge from hell until my arm can strike no longer and my tongue can speak no more.</p> <p>"I shall oppose it because I hear the cries of children who are hungering for bread. I shall oppose it because I see a mother's wasted face, her pale lips pleading with the besotted figure at her side.</p> <p>"I shall oppose it because I see the staggering forms of men whose trembling hands hold but the ashes of their strength and pride.</p> <p>He concluded, "I shall oppose it because its abolition will mean a new stability for the Republic, a new radiance for the flag."</p> <p>Just months later, toward the end of 1913, the two biggest anti-liquor groups in the nation decided the time was right for an even more dramatic move. To end the scourge of alcohol now and for future generations, they proposed a national solution--not just a law, but an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would forever ban the sale of liquor throughout the country. To champion their cause in the U.S. Senate, they turned to Morris Sheppard.</p> <p>On a chilly winter day in December 1913, some 4,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., to take crucial steps toward changing America's drinking habits once and for all. Leading the march were children.</p> <p>Sheppard was elected to the Senate in 1913.</p> <p>At the very front, a young boy carried an American flag. Just behind him, dozens of girls in white dresses carried banners calling for a national prohibition on alcohol. Following them were Woman's Christian Temperance Union members from every state, many wearing the white ribbons that symbolized prohibition. Some sang their anthem, "A Saloonless Nation by 1920."</p> <p>Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Anti-Saloon League members march toward the Capitol in 1913 to present a proposed prohibition amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p> <p>Joining from another direction were the men of the Anti-Saloon League. Together, they marched to the Capitol. Waiting on the steps to receive a proposed constitutional amendment were Senator Sheppard and Representative Richmond Pearson Hobson of Alabama.</p> <p>Later that day, Sheppard introduced this constitutional amendment in Congress for the first time, saying, "The fact that alcohol undermines the brain and paralyzes the will of man, planting in him and his posterity the seeds of physical and moral degeneracy, the seeds of disease, the seeds of poverty, the seeds of crime, makes it a peril to the very existence of free government. Let the people of this Nation insert in the National Constitution, the source of the Nation's life, a clause prohibiting an evil that will prove to be the source of the nation's death."</p> <p>Results might take years. But with patience and determination, Sheppard and his supporters could--and would--change the culture, the behavior, and the course of America.</p> <p>For his role, Morris Sheppard would be known as the Father of National Prohibition. It would turn out to be a most dubious distinction.</p> <p>A playbill highlights the sobering message of Ten Nights in a Bar Room, a popular, long-running temperance play.</p> <p>BOOTLEG Text copyright � 2011 by Karen Blumenthal</p></p><h2>Introduction to Aristotle (Modern Library)</h2><p>Includes the complete <b>Posterior Analytics, De Anima, Nichomachean, Ethics</b>, and <b>Poetics</b> with selections from <b>Physics, Metaphysics, and Politics</b></p><p>"The achievement of Aristotle can be discovered only by reading and rereading his works....The Middle Ages may seem to have exaggerated in calling him The Philosopher, but the understanding of what he said is still an unparalleled introduction to philosophy."<br> --Richard McKeon<br><br><b>The Modern Library</b> has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Pleasantries will be exchanged. Clooney will shake his hand, giving Adored Wife a wry look <em>(Him? Really?),</em> and as the happy couple walks away to their snazzy car, the heartbreaker of old is already forgotten. But <em>he</em> will gaze longingly after her, wondering how he ever could've been so blind.<br><br>That would've been nice. Much nicer, Posey Oster-hagen acknowledged, than being dressed in the waitress uniform of Guten Tag, her parents' restaurant&#x2014;dirndl, ruffled skirt and vest embroidered with dwarves (yes, dwarves), not to mention the green tights and painted red clogs. Cheeks bulging with the potato dumpling she'd just crammed into her mouth, as she was at the near-fainting part of her flea-like metabolism. The back door opened and there he was, standing right in front of her.<br><br>Liam Declan Murphy, the first man she'd ever loved, and the only man who'd ever broken her heart.<br><br>No Clooney. No jewelry. Just an empty kitchen in an aging German restaurant and a fist-size dumpling practically splitting her cheeks.<br><br>Posey's mind blipped into the blue screen of death&#x2014;all data erased. Fatal error. Speaking was clearly not an option.<br><br>His eyes were still that unnerving shade of clear, glacier green. Black hair showed no signs of gray or thinning. Still tall&#x2014;<em>obviously, Posey, people don't usually shrink in their thirties.</em> Still radiating his bad-boy <em>You want me/I ignore you</em> vibe. Oh...bieber. This was just not good. <em>Chew, Posey, chew,</em> her brain instructed. She obeyed with difficulty. It was a big dumpling.<br><br>Liam was dressed in jeans, T-shirt and leather jacket, pretty much the same thing he wore back in high school, if memory served. And memory seemed to be wicked clear where Liam Murphy was concerned. He'd come to Bellsford to live with an uncle after getting out of juvie (squee!&#x2014;okay, okay, she'd been fifteen, it had seemed uber-hot back then) for car theft. Rode an old motorcycle (come on!) and, as legend had it, had turned quite a few girls into women (gack). But, to everyone's surprise, he'd fallen for the squeakiest-clean girl in school, just like a plotline on <em>Beverly Hills 90210,</em> Posey's favorite show back then. When Emma Tate had gone off to college in California, Liam had followed. Eventually, they'd gotten married. It had been in the paper, before Emma's parents had moved to Maine. And here he was.<br><br>"Liam!" cried her mother. Stacia Osterhagen, six foot two of Germanic engineering, tromped into the kitchen, rattling the stacked dishware. "Posey! Look who's here! We forgot to tell you! Max! Liam's here! Liam, sweetheart, why didn't you come in the front?"<br><br>"Force of habit, I guess," he said with a slight smile at her mother.<br><br>"Good to see you, son," Max said heartily, shaking their visitor's hand. Liam Declan Murphy. Holy Elvis Presley.<br><br>"You remember Liam, don't you, honey?" Stacia said.<br><br>Cheeks still bulging, Posey nodded. Could she look any more ridiculous? Not that she was exactly gifted with girliness when it came to clothes&#x2014;her work required sturdy stuff, so, sure, there was a lot of flannel, a lot of Carhartt. But even that would be better than her uniform (same one from high school, still regrettably roomy in the bust, as Germans didn't take small chests into account when designing clothes, apparently).<br><br>"Hey," he said with the same disinterested tone she remembered with unfortunate clarity. "How are you, Cordelia?" His tone implied he really didn't care. And <em>Cordelia.</em> That was another thing. He'd always called her by her real name, for some reason...a name Posey hated. Honestly&#x2014;bad enough to have been stick-figure skinny in high school, but to bear the name Cordelia Wilhelmina Osterhagen (named for a half-blind great-aunt who'd died by falling into a well)...Obviously, she'd had more than her fair share of mocking.<br><br>"I'm good," she squeaked, finally swallowing the last of the dumpling. "Hi. How are you?" "Fine, thanks."<br><br>"Good! Good. Um...how's Emma?"<br><br>"She died," he answered coolly.<br><br>Posey's head jerked back in shock. "What? Are you kidding?"<br><br>He gave her a glacial look. "No."<br><br>How had she missed this news? "But...when did this happen?"<br><br>"It'll be three years in October."<br><br>That explained something, at least. Two and a half years ago, in October, Posey had taken a rare vacation and spent a few weeks in North Carolina. And she'd been a latecomer to Facebook, so if there'd been chatter, she'd missed it. And she and Emma hadn't exactly run with the same people.<br><br>"I'm so sorry," she said, her face burning.<br><br>Emma Tate, <em>dead?</em> Crikey! She'd been a nice girl. A <em>very</em> nice girl and a very popular girl back in high school, when such things seemed mutually exclusive. "So, what happened?" Posey asked. Then, aware that perhaps this was none of her business, she added, "I mean, you don't have to tell me. It's...I don't have to know. It's your...private, um...thing."<br><br>"Leukemia," Liam answered.<br><br>Posey flinched. "I'm so, so sorry."<br><br>"A tragedy," Max added. "Such a sweet girl."<br><br>"He told us at Home Depot the other day," Stacia said. "You know how the fan in the upstairs bathroom has been broken for years? Well, we thought it was time to finally fix it, since Gretchen's coming home, and there we were and who did we see but this handsome boy! We were so sad to hear about Emma. So sad."<br><br>Granted, not sad enough to tell Posey, despite the fact that Stacia called her every morning at 8:15. Then again, not passing on big news was a family tradition. Stacia had told Posey about Carol Antonelli's gallbladder surgery in relentless detail, as well as how much they'd saved by driving forty miles to buy coffee at Stop &amp; Shop instead of Hannaford's, sure. But bigger news&#x2014;deaths, births, marriages, etc.&#x2014;tended to fall through the cracks.<br><br>A sudden flash of memory caused a lump to come to Posey's throat&#x2014;Emma at Sweetie Sue's Ice Cream Parlor, loading up a waffle cone with four scoops instead of three, a conspiratorial wink as she handed it over the counter.<br><br>"I'm really sorry," she said more quietly.<br><br>"Thanks," Liam said, still staring with that cold, disinterested gaze.<br><br>Posey looked away, torn between sympathy, guilt for not knowing about Emma, trepidation (Liam had done some damage, after all), and, yes, lust. "You guys have a kid, right?" she asked. At least she remembered that.<br><br>"Nicole. She's fifteen now."<br><br>"Wow. Fifteen. That's...Wow. Fifteen."<br><br>Liam didn't answer, but his look was loaded with that same disdain Posey so well remembered.<br><br>Once upon a time, when he was channeling Bono, Liam had worked right here in Guten Tag, a miraculous and agonizing time for Posey. The fact that the Osterhagens had given Liam a job at a time when his reputation was questionable (and fascinating) hadn't caused Liam to warm up to Posey, however. Nope. He always treated her with the same interest he might give a speck of dust.<br><br>At first, anyway.<br><br>Whatever. Mom was gabbling away. "Liam, sweetheart, you haven't changed a bit! You have to stay for a drink! You have to! Did you eat? We'll feed you. I insist. Max, you insist, too, don't you?"<br><br>"I also insist," Max said, smiling.<br><br>"Just a drink," Liam said. "I have to get back to my daughter."<br><br>Just then Otto, a longtime waiter and accordion player at Guten Tag, poked his head through the door to the dining room. "Max, Stacia, the Schmottlachs are leaving."<br><br>"Posey, make Liam at home, would you? Liam, this will just take a minute. Bruce and Shirley are our best friends. You remember them, don't you?"<br><br>Liam's mouth pulled into a reluctant smile as Stacia grabbed Max by the hand and towed him into the dining room. Said smile caused Posey's girl parts to clench in a warm, strong squeeze. <em>Hello!</em> Her stomach began flipping like an overexcited dolphin. Alone. She was <em>alone</em> with Hottie McSin, widower. Oh, crikey, that wasn't nice. She shouldn't be lusting after the poor guy. Except the words <em>poor guy</em> didn't seem to apply to Liam Murphy. She swallowed, the sound louder than a gunshot in the now-quiet kitchen.<br><br>Meanwhile, God's gift to women&#x2014;because, yes, he was that good...all smoldering male beauty made all the more inaccessible by that touch of disdain&#x2014;folded his arms and looked around the kitchen.<br><br>It was hard to fathom that bright, bouncy Emma Tate was gone. Posey swallowed again, her throat thick. "How's your daughter handling things?"<br><br>"Pretty well." He allowed her a brief glance.<br><br>"So, what brings you here? Just visiting?"<br><br>"No. We moved to be closer to Emma's parents."<br><br>He was <em>back?</em> Staying? "Oh. Um...that's nice. Good. I mean, it's good to be close to family. Good for children, I mean."<br><br>He didn't answer. Didn't ask what she'd been up to, if she was married, if she had kids. Of course not. Apparently he was still way too cool to care about&#x2014;<br><br>"So, what have you been up to, Cordelia?"<br><br>Oops. Strike that. "Oh, I'm just filling in tonight. I own an architectural salvage company," she said, well aware of the pride that tinged her voice. He didn't respond, just gave a half nod. "What about you?"<br><br>"I'm a mechanic. I build custom motorcycles."<br><br>Of <em>course</em> he was a motorcycle mechanic. This would enable him to wear leather and smell like oil and have large throbbing machines between his thighs. At the image, Posey's legs weakened. <em>Down, girl.</em> It wouldn't do to wrestle him to the floor here in her parents' kitchen. But he'd always had that effect on her&#x2014;and every other female. He was like the Death Star's tractor beam, pulling in whatever the heck it wanted. "Motorcycles. Neat-o," she managed.<br><br>Liam's glance bounced around the kitchen once more. He sighed, perhaps irked that there was no one else to talk to, then looked back at her. "You married?"<br><br>"Um, no. Nope. Not married. Not yet, I guess I should say. I, um...well, you know. Haven't met the right guy." Oh, bieber. That made her sound...unwanted. "Not yet. I mean, actually I'm seeing someone...um, and, you know, I came close once or twice, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Came close to what?" Stacia asked, banging through the kitchen doors once more.<br><br>Posey jumped. "Nothing," she muttered, tugging at her dwarf-embroidered vest.<br><br>"Cordelia was telling me about when she almost got married," Liam said. Was that derision in his voice? Probably.<br><br>"What? You almost <em>what?"</em> Stacia pressed a large hand to her ample bosom. "My own child, and I don't know this&#x2014;"<br><br>"Mom, stop. It was...you know." Posey took a deep breath. "Ron. You remember."<br><br>"The one with the rash?"<br><br>Posey grimaced. "It cleared up very quickly."<br><br>"He was the one who turned gay, right? Liam, honestly. Posey just cannot find a normal man, not that she tries very hard, working out at that junkyard&#x2014;"<br><br>"It's not a junkyard. It's architectural salvage." <em>And I am seeing a normal man, I just don't want you to keel over if I tell you who.</em><br><br>"I always say, if she'd just clean up a little, some man would see what a beautiful, sweet&#x2014;" Stacia broke off, a religious gleam beginning in her sky-blue eyes. Ruh-roh. Posey knew that look. It was the look of Matchmaker, one Posey had seen far too many times over the years. Ron the Gay with the Rash had been one of Stacia's better picks, actually. There'd been Carol Antonelli's nephew, who'd taken her to McDonald's on their first date and didn't even pay for her Big Mac. The restaurant-supply guy who'd turned out to have two families, one in New Hampshire, one in Delaware. And now, the look of Matchmaker with Liam.<br><br><em>Don't do it, Mom,</em> Posey begged silently, hunching her shoulders to ward off the blow.<br><br>The blow came, though not the one she expected. "You'll have to come back and meet my niece, Liam," Stacia said. "Gretchen? From <em>The Barefoot Fraulein?</em> On the Cooking Network? She's my late sister's daughter. We're so proud of her! Have you ever seen her show?"<br><br>"Can't say that I have," he murmured. He glanced again at Posey, eyes dropping to her costume. Just in case she forgot that she looked like an idiot.<br><br>"Well, you'll have to come by," Stacia said. "We were just thrilled when she told us she wanted to come work here! And she's such a sweet, sweet girl." Mom paused cunningly. "Very pretty, too."<br><br>Gretchen <em>was</em> very pretty, Posey would give her that. She looked much like Stacia&#x2014;tall, blonde, blue-eyed, voluptuous&#x2014;German beauty at its finest. Posey, on the other hand, was adopted&#x2014;five foot three (five two and a half, why lie?), a hundred and seven pounds, dark, short, difficult hair and brown eyes. As for Gretchen's sweetness...Posey stifled a snort.<br><br>"We could use a little help, to be honest," her mom continued. "Ever since that&#x2014;" Stacia took a meaningful breath "&#x2014;that <em>Italian</em> restaurant moved in down the street, business has been a little slow."<br><br>Business had been slow well before Inferno opened, though Posey knew her mom would never admit it. Guten Tag's food wasn't bad, if you liked old-school German cuisine (which, it must be said, most people didn't). The slogan&#x2014;<em>We'll feed you till you're stuffed!</em>&#x2014;didn't exactly scream gourmet dining.<br><br>Inferno, on the other hand, was only six months old and had already been reviewed by the <em>New York Times</em> (four stars). They had a slogan, too, one that appeared on the local television stations and in swanky tourist magazines&#x2014;<em>Our life's mission: to make the best meal of your life.</em><br><br></p><h2>The Burning Shore</h2><p><p>`Centaine screamed and drove the point of her stave down into the jaws with all her strength.

Ghost girl.<br><br>I could get used to this, seats unmarked by the pocked craters of cigarette burns, no blaring adboards, no gangsters checking you out. But elevated status is not part of the program. Only allocated for the day, to get me in and out again. Wouldn&#x2019;t want civilians hanging around.<br><br>As the train slows, pulling into the Waterfront Exec station, it sends plumes of seawater arcing up the sides. In my defence, it&#x2019;s automatic; I lift my camera, firing off three shots through the latticed residue of salt crusted over the windows. I don&#x2019;t think about the legal restrictions on documenting corporate space, that this might be provocation enough to revoke the special access pass Andile loaded onto my phone for the occasion.<br><br>&#x2018;They don&#x2019;t like that, you know,&#x2019; says the guy sitting across the way from me. He doesn&#x2019;t look like he belongs here either, with his scruffy beard and hair plastered into wet tufts. Older than me, maybe twenty-seven, twenty-eight. He&#x2019;s wearing a damp neoprene surf peel, a surfboard slung casually at his feet, half blocking the aisle.<br><br>&#x2018;Then I&#x2019;ll delete it,&#x2019; I snap. It&#x2019;s impossible, of course. I&#x2019;m using my F2, picked up cheap-cheap along with my Hasselblad at the Milnerton market during the last big outbreak, when everyone thought this was really it. It&#x2019;s oldschool. Film. You&#x2019;d have to rip it out the back, expose it to the light. But no one&#x2019;s ever sharp enough to notice that it&#x2019;s analogue.<br><br>&#x2018;Kit kat,&#x2019; he says, &#x2018;I was just saying. They&#x2019;re sensitive round these parts. All the proprietary tech.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;No, thanks. Really. I appreciate it.&#x2019; I make a show of fiddling with the back of the camera before I shove it in my bag, trying not to think that I&#x2019;m included in that definition now &#x2013; just as much proprietary technology.<br><br>&#x2018;See you around,&#x2019; he says, like it&#x2019;s a sure thing, standing up as the doors open with an asthmatic hiss. He&#x2019;s left a damp patch on the seat.<br><br>&#x2018;Yeah, sure,&#x2019; I say, trying to sound friendly as I step onto the station platform. But the encounter has made me edgy, reinforced just how out of place I am here. It&#x2019;s enough to make me duck my head as I pass the station cop at the entrance &#x2013; behaviour the cameras are poised to look for, not to mention the dogs. The Aito sitting alert and panting at the cop&#x2019;s feet spares me a glance over its snout, no more, not picking up any incriminating chem scents, no suspiciously spiked adrenalin levels or residue of police mace. His operator doesn&#x2019;t even bother to look at me, just waves me through the checkpoint with a cursory scan of my phone, verifying my bioID, the temporary access pass.<br><br>It&#x2019;s only six blocks but my pass isn&#x2019;t valid for walking rights, so Andile has arranged an agency car, already waiting for me on the concourse. I nearly miss it, because it&#x2019;s marked only by a Vukani Media licence plate. The name means &#x2018;Awake! Arise! Fight!&#x2019;, which makes me wonder who they&#x2019;re supposed to be fighting. The driver chuckles wryly when I ask her, but doesn&#x2019;t offer up a theory. We travel in cool professional silence.<br><br>Although my hand itches for my camera, I manage to restrain myself as we pass between the rows of filter trees lining Vukani&#x2019;s driveway, sucking up sunlight and the buffeting wind to power the building. You don&#x2019;t see filter forests much, or at least I don&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;re too expensive to maintain outside the corporate havens.<br><br>Inside, the receptionist explains that she&#x2019;d love to offer me a drink, but it&#x2019;s not recommended just before the procedure. Would I like to have a seat? Andile will be only a minute. And would I mind checking my camera and any other recording devices? I don&#x2019;t have to worry about my phone: they&#x2019;ve got app blockers in place to prevent unauthorised activity.<br><br>I reluctantly hand over my Leica Zion, and after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, the Nikon too.<br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s got half my exhibition on there,&#x2019; I say, indicating the F2.<br><br>&#x2018;Of course, don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll stash it in the safe,&#x2019; she says, against a backdrop of awards &#x2013; gold statuettes of African masks and perspex Loeries with wings flung wide.<br><br>I take a seat in the lounge, feeling naked without my cameras. And then Andile arrives in a fluster of energy and hustles me towards the lift. He&#x2019;s got the kind of personality that precedes him, stirring up the atoms before he even enters the room.<br><br>&#x2018;There she is. Right on time, babes.&#x2019; He honestly speaks like this. &#x2018;You get in all right? No hassles?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It was fine. Apart from nearly being ejected because I took a photograph of the underway.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Oh babes, you got to rein in those urges. You don&#x2019;t want to look like one of those public sector activists with their greater-good-tech-wants-to-be-free crap. Although those pics will be worth something when you&#x2019;re famous. Any chance I could get a print?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;To go with the rest of your collection?&#x2019;<br><br>His office on the seventeenth floor is colonised by an assortment of hip ephemera, a lot of it borderline illegal. The most blatant example is the low-fi subtech on his bookshelf, a cobbled-together satellite radio smuggled in from the Rural in defiance of the quarantines, which probably only makes it more valuable, more flauntable. It all goes with the creative director territory, along with the pink shirt and the tasteful metal plug in his right ear. The stolen photographs of the underway would fit right in.<br><br>What <i>doesn&#x2019;t</i> fit in is the contract. The wedge of white pages on the desk among the menagerie of vinyl toys seems antiseptic, too clinical to gel with all the fun, fun, fun around it.<br><br>The bio-sig pen I signed with (here, and here, and here) had microscopic barbs in the shaft that scraped skin cells from the pad of my thumb to mix with the ink. Signed in blood. Or DNA, which is close enough.<br><br>&#x2018;Adams, K.?&#x2019; A woman steps through the doorway from the boardroom, all crisp professionalism in a dark suit, holding a folder with my name printed on it in caps.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m Dr. Precious.

Even ad agencies with big name biotech clients on their books don&#x2019;t tend to have in-house doctors. Andile claims it&#x2019;s because, &#x2018;The labs are so impersonal, babes.&#x2019; But I suspect that it&#x2019;s easier to bring her in here to shoot us up one at a time than to get the necessary security clearance for twelve art punks to enter a restricted biomed research facility.<br>Not that the rest are art punks necessarily. All Andile will say is that they&#x2019;re hot talent. Young, dynamic, creative, on the up, the perfect ambassadors for the brand.<br><br>&#x2018;You know the type, babes,&#x2019; he said in interview #1, when I was sitting in his office, still reeling from the purgatory of dropping out, my dad&#x2019;s cancer, wondering how I got here.<br><br>&#x2018;DJs, filmmakers, rockstar kids, and you, of course,&#x2019; he winked, only emphasising that this is all a mistake, that I am out of their league. &#x2018;All Ghost&#x2019;s hipster chosen.&#x2019; But we don&#x2019;t get to mingle until the official media launch party.<br><br>&#x2018;Just in case one of you goes into meltdown,&#x2019; Andile said in interview #3, when it was already too late to pull out. As if I&#x2019;d even consider it. &#x2018;Ha-ha.&#x2019;<br><br>Dr. Precious loads a silver capsule like a bullet into the back of the autosyringe. She&#x2019;s too smooth to be a doctor-doctor. She&#x2019;s not worn hollow from the public sector, new outbreaks, new strains. Inatec Biologica it says on the logotag clipped to her lapel.<br><br>Before interview #1, I thought their line was limited to cosmetics. I imagine her in a white coat and face-mask in a sleek lab that is all stainless steel and ergonomic curves, like in the toothpaste commercials. Or behind a cosmetics counter, spritzing wafts of perfume and handing out fifty-g samples of the topshelf biotech creams (one per customer, please). This isn&#x2019;t so different after all. It&#x2019;s just that the average nano in your average anti-ageing moisturiser acts only on the subdermal level. Mine, on the other hand, is going all the way.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t sweat it, Kendra,&#x2019; Andile said back in interview #3, seeing my face. &#x2018;The chances of meltdown are like zero. They&#x2019;ve been using the same tech in animals for years. Cop dogs, the Aitos, you know, guide dogs, those helper monkeys for the disabled. Well, not quite the same, obviously.&#x2019;<br><br>Which doesn&#x2019;t mean that the contract didn&#x2019;t include a host of clauses indemnifying Ghost, their parent company Prima-Sabine FoodSolutions International, Vukani, Inatec Biologica and all their respective agencies and employees against any unforeseen side-effects.<br><br>&#x2018;So, how long before the mutation kicks in?&#x2019; I ask, acting like it&#x2019;s no big deal, as Dr. Precious swipes at the crook of my elbow with a disinfectant swab, probably loaded with its own nano or specially cultivated germ-eating bacteria or whatever new innovation Inatec&#x2019;s come up with specially.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh babes,&#x2019; says Andile, mock-hurt. &#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t we agree we weren&#x2019;t going to call it that? Promise me you won&#x2019;t use that word in the interviews.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What did you have for breakfast?&#x2019; says Dr. Precious unexpectedly. But her question is a ruse. Before I can think to answer (cold oats at Jonathan&#x2019;s apartment, no sign of Jonathan, but that&#x2019;s not unusual lately), she snaps the autosyringe against my arm like a staple gun. And just like that, three million designer robotic microbes go singing through my veins.<br><br>It doesn&#x2019;t even hurt.<br><br>Considering the hype, the bulk of the contract, I am expecting nothing less than for the world to rearrange. Instead, it&#x2019;s like having sex for the first time. As in, is that it?<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s it. It&#x2019;ll take four to six hours for the tech to circulate. Do you want me to run through it again? You may experience flu symptoms: running nose, headaches, sore throat in the first twenty-four hours. Then it&#x2019;ll stop. Enjoy it. It&#x2019;s probably the last time you&#x2019;ll ever get sick.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All perfectly normal, babes. Just your body adjusting,&#x2019; Andile chips in.<br><br>Just my immune system kicking into overdrive to war with the nanotech invasion. But it&#x2019;s only temporary. People adapt. Evolve. It&#x2019;s all in the manual, although I haven&#x2019;t read all the fineline. Who does?<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll see you here for a check-up next week.&#x2019; Dr. Precious ejects the silver capsule from the back of the autosyringe and slots it carefully back into the case with the other empty shells. Can&#x2019;t leave that stuff lying around. Light catches the gleaming shells, the reflection of Dr. Precious stretched thin like a Giacometti sculpture.<br><br>I&#x2019;m already planning a timelapse, to capture the change. Only the top three layers of the epidermis, Andile was at pains to point out, a negligible inconvenience to carry with you for a lifetime.<br><br>If I could embed a camera inside my body, I would. But all I can do is document the cells mutating on the inside of my wrist, the pattern developing, fading up like an oldschool Polaroid as the nano spreads through my system.<br><br>My skin is already starting to itch.</p><h2>When I&#39;m Sleepy</h2><p>A child speculates about sleeping next to various animals in various places other than one&#39;s own, and most desirable, warm bed.</p><p>Ages 1-5. Now available in a large, sturdy board book edition, this enchanting bedtime story will soothe and beguile children and adults alike. As a little girl wonders what it would be like to sleep like animals do--curled up in a basket, or hanging upside down, or lying in a hollow log--the carefully detailed pictures show her peacefully slumbering as she rests on a cat&#39;s warm fur, hangs companionably next to a bat, and is lovingly held by a raccoon. Although many of the pictures are funny, the overall atmosphere of the book is tender, dreamy and (yawn) very soporific.<b>Jane Howard</b> lives in Deerfield, Illinois.</p><h2>My Enchanted Garden: Applique Quilts in Cotton and Wool</h2><p><p>Bask in beautiful designs from Gretchen Gibbons.

Though &#x201c;learn&#x201d; is fairly generous. I have almost no idea how it works. My powers can snap on without warning, or fizzle in seconds.</p><p>VB: Still, that&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. incredible. It took me weeks to gain even that much control. [PAUSE] How&#x2019;d this happen? How&#x2019;d you suddenly become&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Viral?</p><p>CC: I was careless. Didn&#x2019;t take proper precautions in the lab. Then, last week, I got terribly sick. Could barely function. Strange things started happening to my body&#x2014;unnerving side effects you won&#x2019;t find on WebMD. By that point, I no longer had any illusions about the cause.</p><p>VB: The weird sensation I&#x2019;ve been experiencing lately&#x2014;an odd kinetic force, like my mind is connecting to things around me&#x2014;it spikes around you. Because of you, I&#x2019;m sure of it now. How can that be?</p><p>CC: Don&#x2019;t ask me. I&#x2019;m new to the species, remember? [PAUSE] Maybe it involves whatever sets you apart from normal people. Sets us apart, I should say, now. Perhaps your unconscious mind innately recognizes the presence of another Viral.</p><p>VB: That can&#x2019;t be it. I&#x2019;ve had this feeling for months now, off and on, since right after the hurricane. I noticed it at least a half-dozen times before last week.</p><p>CC: Yeah. Um, about that. [PAUSE]</p><p>VB: Yes?</p><p>CC: Well. You know I&#x2019;ve been following you. [PAUSE] But you probably don&#x2019;t know for how long.</p><p>VB: What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for months? [PAUSE] Months!?! Seriously? Are you saying you were in Charlotte after the storm?</p><p>CC: Had to go somewhere.</p><p>VB: What about Morris Island?</p><p>CC: I&#x2019;ve visited a few times, unannounced.</p><p>VB: Even to our&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. private retreat?</p><p>CC: You mean that hill bunker? [LAUGHTER] Nice place. I love the d�cor. How&#x2019;d you get all that stuff in there?</p><p>VB: Jesus. [PAUSE] How&#x2019;d you find it? Because of me?</p><p>CC: I don&#x2019;t pretend to understand any of this. But sometimes, if I concentrate really hard, I can pinpoint exactly where you are. I sense your presence, perhaps in the same way you detected mine. I can&#x2019;t explain it, either.</p><p>VB: I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>CC: Also, I&#x2019;m fairly certain I&#x2019;ve been infected for a while. Months, most likely, probably since the first few days of the Brimstone experiment. What you just said&#x2014;that you&#x2019;ve been sensing my presence for some time&#x2014;all but confirms it.</p><p>VB: How is that possible? How could you carry a supervirus that long and not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. change?</p><p>CC: I have a guess. The parvovirus strain used in Brimstone was slightly different from the one that infected you. Better, we thought, though we obviously had no idea what we were doing. I think our pathogen has a longer incubation period, which would explain the course of my infection. This viral deviation must&#x2019;ve caused other differences, too.</p><p>VB: Your eyes glow red, Chance. Not golden. Why?</p><p>CC: [PAUSE] I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I did. I&#x2019;m just glad I stopped puking all day.</p><p>VB: How do you feel now?</p><p>CC: Great. My fever broke yesterday. The chills and sweats are finally gone. I can actually stand without feeling dizzy. But I have no idea what&#x2019;s happened to my body.</p><p>VB: Yesterday? [PAUSE] Interesting.</p><p>CC: Why?</p><p>VB: Because our flares were a mess last week. Erratic. Unstable. Mine backfired more than once. We couldn&#x2019;t understand why, but it seems like the trouble occurred during your worst symptoms.</p><p>CC: You think my sickness was somehow related?</p><p>VB: I don&#x2019;t know. But our powers stabilized at the same time you recovered.</p><p>CC: Could be a coincidence.</p><p>VB: Maybe. [PAUSE] Or maybe your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. transformation was disrupting whatever shared mind-space Virals inhabit. We don&#x2019;t really know how any of this works either. Perhaps your evolution created a ripple in the telepathic framework of our pack. That makes as much sense as anything.</p><p>CC: Our pack? Does that mean I&#x2019;m one of you?</p><p>VB: I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s not up to me alone. It might not even be something we can choose.</p><p>CC: Well, I hope we can choose, Tory. I hope your friends will accept me.</p><p>VB: I&#x2019;ll try to convince them. I promise that much.</p><p>CC: Good. Because I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [LONG PAUSE][MUFFLED NOISE]</p><p>VB: Chance?</p><p>CC: I haven&#x2019;t told you everything yet. [PAUSE]</p><p>VB: Oh my God. [PAUSE] The night on the beach!</p><p>CC: I was wondering when you&#x2019;d remember.</p><p>VB: When I was attacked on Morris Island, afterward I saw three sets of red eyes in the dunes. Three, Chance!</p><p>CC: Yes. I&#x2019;m afraid you did.</p><p>[END TRANSCRIPT]</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Trinity peered down from atop a church tower.</p><p>They sat stone still, watching the sleek black skyscraper across the street. Brilliant white lettering along its apex labeled it the worldwide headquarters of Candela Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The Four had entered hours ago. The sun had set, yet they remained inside.</p><p>Night blanketed the city. Cloaking the figures in darkness.</p><p>A low growl floated on the wind.</p><p>The largest turned bloodred eyes on two companions.</p><p>A jerk of the head motioned them to follow.</p><p>They were ready. Determined. But it would have to be another day.</p><p>As one, the trio crept across a narrow ledge, ignoring heart-stopping drops to either side, and vaulted gracefully onto a lower roof. Moving like ghosts, they leaped to a willow tree in the yard below, then dropped into a small cemetery.</p><p>The smallest hissed softly.</p><p>The largest grunted in agreement.</p><p><i>Soon.</i></p><p>The Four lived on a remote island.</p><p>The Trinity had observed their alpha there once before.</p><p>She and her mixed-blood beast.</p><p>Rivals.</p><p>A second growl escaped, louder than the first.</p><p><i>Soon.</i></p><p>With preternatural grace, the figures melted into the shadowy field of tombstones.</p><p>Three haunting calls echoed down the streets of Charleston.</p><p><i>Soon.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>My adversary charged at full speed, intent on running me down.</p><p><i>Not this time.</i></p><p>I nudged the ball left, deftly sidestepping the girl&#x2019;s clumsy challenge. Keeping my head up, I spotted Ella twenty yards ahead, streaking for the corner. The field opened like a book, and for once, I knew what to do.</p><p>I booted the ball into Ella&#x2019;s path, then cut behind her, racing to a pocket of space across midfield. As a fullback I rarely ventured forward, but I was tired of playing it safe. The game was deadlocked at zero, and goals don&#x2019;t score themselves.</p><p>Plus, the blonde, ponytailed freak who just missed spiking my ankle had been attacking relentlessly all game. Four hard fouls were enough. Time to put <i>her</i> on the defensive.</p><p>Ella corralled the ball, dancing between two hopeless opponents before noticing my run in support. She pulled the ball back, drawing the defenders closer, then lofted a cross over James Island Charter&#x2019;s entire back line.</p><p>I experienced a brief moment of panic as the ball arced toward me.</p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t embarrass yourself, Brennan.</i></p><p>Thankfully, I didn&#x2019;t. Chesting the ball down, I was shocked to find myself completely unmarked. Thirty yards of open grass separated me and the opposing goalie.</p><p>&#x201c;Push forward!&#x201d; Ella shouted.</p><p><i>Oh crap oh crap oh crap.</i> But I drove the ball ahead.</p><p>To say I lacked confidence in my soccer skills is an understatement. I&#x2019;d only been playing a few months, and charging the other team&#x2019;s goal without support, during the biggest game of the season, was not something I&#x2019;d planned.</p><p><i>Please, God. Don&#x2019;t let me trip over the ball.</i></p><p>As I neared the eighteen-yard box, a defender barreled over. I tapped the ball between her outstretched legs and raced around the awkward slide tackle, nearly stumbling in surprise when the move actually worked. The keeper charged, a look of desperation on her face.</p><p><i>Chip it over. Score. Win!</i></p><p>But before I could exploit the opening, my legs were ruthlessly hacked out from under me. I fell forward, slamming into the turf with a groan. A cleat dug into the small of my back as someone flopped over me from behind.</p><p>My head spun. The whistle blew.</p><p>I heard Ella shouting. What sounded like shoving.</p><p>I looked up.</p><p>Blonde Ponytail was standing astride the ball. She and Ella were nose to nose, and they weren&#x2019;t discussing favorite boy bands. The harridan even had the gall to protest when the official showed her a yellow card. Unfortunately, Ella got one, too.</p><p>I rose unsteadily, wiping dirt from my purple Bolton Prep uniform. The official stepped between Ella and Ponytail and signaled a free kick for our side.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Ella was staring at my tormentor, face red with anger.</p><p>&#x201c;Never better.&#x201d; Gulping air into my lungs. &#x201c;She seems nice.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella laughed, but the humor didn&#x2019;t touch her eyes. &#x201c;That bitch knows you&#x2019;re better with your feet, so she&#x2019;s bull-rushing the ball, trying to intimidate you. Don&#x2019;t let her.&#x201d;</p><p>The official placed the ball fifteen feet beyond the edge of the box, then paced off ten yards. He glanced at his watch. There were only moments left in the match.</p><p>As the James Island defenders formed a wall, I began to retreat to my fullback slot.</p><p>Ella grabbed my arm. &#x201c;Want this one? You definitely earned it.&#x201d;</p><p>A generous thought, but Ella was worlds better than me. And everyone else on the field.</p><p>Not to mention that taking a game-deciding free kick was too terrifying to contemplate. I&#x2019;d probably find a way to knock it into our own goal.</p><p>Ella frowned. &#x201c;Well, at least get up there. Look for a rebound.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could react, Ella cupped her hands to her mouth. &#x201c;Maddy!&#x201d;</p><p>Madison Dunkle turned. Ella pointed at me, then at Madison, then jerked a thumb over her shoulder. Madison nodded without hesitation, jogging back to cover my position.</p><p>&#x201c;Take her spot in the middle.&#x201d; Ella&#x2019;s rope of black hair brushed the ground as she knelt to position the ball on the grass. We both knew it&#x2019;d take a miracle to score from this distance. &#x201c;If the ball bounces your way, just blast it on goal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That I can do.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I think.</i></p><p>Joining the line of players jockeying for position, I felt an elbow dig into my back. Right where the cleat had struck.</p><p>I spun, knowing who I&#x2019;d find. My temper slipped a notch.</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful, ginger princess.&#x201d; Ponytail&#x2019;s eyes glittered with malice. &#x201c;No more dancing. Things can get rough up here.&#x201d;</p><p>My anger was reaching a boil. &#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;</p><p>The hateful girl shouldered into me, forcing me outside the eighteen-yard box. &#x201c;Even without your mommy to protect you?&#x201d; She nodded toward Ella, who was lining up her strike. All eyes were on my friend as she prepared to take the free kick.</p><p>Maybe it was ninety minutes of abuse.</p><p>Or Ponytail&#x2019;s smug attitude. Or the hard foul. Or the fact that I was hungry.</p><p>Maybe it was her referencing my mother.</p><p>SNAP.</p><p>I felt a rush of adrenaline.</p><p>A thousand suns torched my skin, followed by an ocean of freezing rain.</p><p>Energy poured into my muscles. My senses blazed with hyperacuity. Smell. Sight. Sound. Feel. Taste. Each shifted to superhuman clarity and perception.</p><p>Golden fire ignited in my eyes.</p><p>I <i>flared.</i></p><p>In public. In the open.</p><p>In the middle of a freaking soccer game.</p><p>I quickly averted my eyes. Thankfully, everyone was watching Ella.</p><p><i>This is crazy. CRAZY.</i></p><p>But I ignored common sense. I was going to show this bully what&#x2019;s what.</p><p>Head lowered, I was about to push back into the scrum when a message winged into my brain.</p><p><i>I was wondering when you&#x2019;d go wolf style on that beast.</i></p><p>I stopped short, gaze darting to the sideline.</p><p>To where Hiram, Shelton, and Ben were lounging on a grassy hill.</p><p><i>Hi! You shouldn&#x2019;t be flaring in public!</i></p><p><i>Oh, you&#x2019;re one to talk.</i> Hi tapped the sunglasses covering his eyes. Like Shelton, he still wore his Bolton Prep uniform, though he&#x2019;d ditched the jacket, loosened his tie, and removed his shoes and socks. <i>Which of us is standing in a group of strangers?</i></p><p>Okay. Fine. And I&#x2019;d connected our pack mind without thinking.</p><p><i>I lost my cool, but&#x2014;</i></p><p><i>Shh! Just listen.</i> Hi pointed a chubby finger. <i>There&#x2019;s no one on the back post.</i></p><p>I glanced to my left, pretending to shade my eyes from the sun. He was right&#x2014;expecting a direct shot, the James Island defenders were clogging the middle of the box.</p><p>No one was guarding the flank.</p><p><i>You&#x2019;re welcome.</i> Hi&#x2019;s message carried a distinct note of smugness.</p><p>Ella was lined up over the ball. I had only seconds.</p><p>As casually as possible, I moved along the wall of defenders until I stood farthest right. Then I stuck an arm behind my back, waggling frantically for Ella&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>At the last moment, she spotted my signal. Her eyes narrowed in confusion.</p><p>I nodded right. Spun my finger in a circle. Tapped my head.</p><p>Ella dipped her chin, then took two steps to the left.</p><p><i>What am I doing?

The Civil War Battle series allows readers to experience the war through the trials, discoveries, and battles of the Brannons, a fictional family living in Virginia. Reasoner has created an incredible fictional tale and interweaved historical information throughout the work.The narrative of "Chancellorsville" begins in Mississippi and the situation on the western front. Before reaching Vicksburg, Cory Brannon stumbles into a campsite where all is not well and briefly encounters a cautious Confederate patrol. A veteran of the battles of Forts Henry and Donelson and Shiloh, but not a soldier in the Confederate army, he continues to search for Lucille Farrell, the daughter of his late employer. When he finds her, he also discovers that he may have a role to play in supplying the South with food, weapons, and ammunition being brought in through Texas by blockade-runners. The path, however, is strewn with renegades and outlaws, and on the horizon there may be a rival for Lucille's affections. <p>Meanwhile, Cory's brothers Will and Mac, enjoy a brief visit with the family members still in Culpeper. Will is greatly relieved that his mother, Abigail, who had banished him from the farm in the weeks before the war, now welcomes him with open arms. Brother Titus's marriage to Polly Ebersole comes as a surprise to the two brothers in gray, but their presence stirs a sense of obligation and duty in the hotheaded Titus. Shortly after the two return to their units- Will to the Shenandoah with jackson and Mac with Stuart near Richmond- the Confederate cause claims another Brannon, this one a gifted rifleman. </p><p>In December 1862 a new Union commander launches another campaign to claim the Southern capital, and Ambrose Burnside brings the Federal army to Fredericksburg. With him marches the conscience-driven Nathan Hatcher. When the battle breaks loose, Will and Mac are on the right side of the Confederate line, and Titus is on the left. After the terrible bloodletting of the Federal defeat, news comes that Titus has been lost. The brothers carry the information back to Culpeper, where the aloof Polly surprisingly grieves over the loss of Titus, her husband. She reaches out to the Brannon family and finds a comforting response from the people from the people she has tried to keep at arm's length. </p><p>In early 1863 a fitful calm pervades the Virginia front until yet another Union commander is named. Jo Hooker leads his army into the wooded wilderness of the Rappahannock again and confidently stakes his fortunes to an encounter with Robert E. Lee near the roadside inn at Chancellorsvile. As the battle rushes toward them, Will and Mac witness the boldest move a field commander can make and the greatest loss the Confederacy can struggle to bear.</p></p><h2>The Rights Retained by the People: The History and Meaning of the Ninth Amendment (Volume 1)</h2><p>This anthology of scholarship by distinguished legal academicians on the Ninth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution comes at a time when interest in the Ninth Amendment is on the rise. <i>The Rights Retained by the People</i> brings together in one volume the critical writings on the Ninth Amendment, from the first published article (1936) to several important articles published in the 1980s.

By the end of the 19th century, she led the world in lighter-than-air flight. Any concern about heavier-than-air flight was dismissed as inevitable, and France would achieve it in due course. By the time Bl�riot bravely enquired &#x2018;Which way is England?&#x2019; the country was ready to redress any perceived shortfall. Besides leading European aviation, France was the nation that named all the parts of an aeroplane with words many of which we still use everywhere today.<br><br>France was also the first nation to stage air exhibitions. Unlike their counterparts in Britain, Germany and America, French designers were thoroughly entrepreneurial and tried a wide variety of adventurous styles from pusher to canard and monoplane to multiplane. In 1909 the first Air Show was held at the Grand Palais. The &#x2018;Exposition Internationale de locomotion a�rienne&#x2019; ushered in what was to become an enduring tradition. Every year, the aircraft exhibitions were a massive success. The interior design by Andr� Granet, who since his youth had been fascinated by flying, was such a success that the Automobile-Club subsequently commissioned Granet to do the same for the car shows.<br><br>It is not surprising that all this derring-do, all these technological achievements and all this innovation drew reporters and photographers like moths to a flame. The men, the machines, the places and the events all were recorded, reported, reproduced and then were filed away. Hundreds of images appeared in print, but thousands were printed up only as contact prints from large-format glass negatives and then disappeared into albums to be forgotten about. In the mid-1990s the author came across one such treasure-trove; a number of dust-covered albums containing around five hundred images of aircraft, airships and expositions &#x2013; it is doubtful if most have appeared in print before, so this will probably be the first time the events of these French pioneers have ever been showcased.</p><p>Graham M. Simons is a highly regarded Aviation historian with extensive contacts within the field. He is the author of Mosquito: The Original Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (2011), B-17 The Fifteen Ton Flying Fortress (2011), and Valkyrie: The North American XB-70 (also 2011), all published by Pen and Sword Books. He lives near Peterborough."This is a very interesting book. It will be of great interest to both modelers and aviation historians as well." (<i>AMPS Indianapolis</i>)<br><br>"Enjoyed it." (<i>Historical Miniatures Gaming Society</i>)<br><br>"In all, it makes for an excellent read for early aviation fans and one you really should have on your book shelf."

In each case the personal is the political as these characters face everything from the emotional pitfalls of everyday life to historic catastrophes on a global scale. In his fifth collection, Shepard makes each of these wildly various worlds his own, and never before has he delineated anything like them so powerfully.</p><p><b>JIM SHEPARD</b> is the author of seven novels and four previous story collections. He lives in Williamstown, Massachusetts, with his wife, three children, and three beagles. He teaches at Williams College.Safety Tips for Living Alone<br><br>Twenty-�five years before Texas Tower no. 4 became one of the Air Force&#x2019;s most unlikely achievements and most lethal peacetime disasters, marooning nineteen wives including Ellie Phelan, Betty Bakke, Edna Kovarick, and Jeannette Laino in their own little stewpots of grief and recrimination, the six-�year-�old Ellie thought of herself as forever stuck in Kansas: someone who would probably never see Chicago, never mind the Atlantic Ocean. Her grandfather wore his old brown duster whatever the weather, and when riding in her father&#x2019;s convertible he always insisted on sitting in the dead center of the backseat with a hand on each side of the top to maintain the car&#x2019;s balance on the road. This was back when the Army was running the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Navy exploring the Pole with Admiral Byrd, and the Air Corps still flying the mail in open-�cockpit biplanes. Gordon had reminded Ellie of her grandfather, and this had stirred her up and set her teeth on edge. She&#x2019;d first noticed him when he&#x2019;d stood on the Ferris wheel before the ride had begun, to make certain another family&#x2019;s toddlers had been adequately strapped in, and when they were introduced she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Who made you the Ferris wheel monitor?&#x201d; And then after he&#x2019;d answered with a grin, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it amazing how much guys like me pretend we know what we&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d been shocked by how exhilarating it was to catch a glimpse of someone who saw the world exactly as she did.<br><br>She&#x2019;d always been moved and appalled by the confidence that men like her grandfather and Gordon projected when it came to getting a handle on their situations. But they each also had a way of responding to her as if she&#x2019;d come around to the advantages of their caretaking, and she surprised herself by not saying no when after a few months of dating he asked her to marry him. That night she stood in her parents&#x2019; room in the dark, annoyed at her turmoil, and then switched on their bedside lamp and told them the news. And when they reacted with some of the same dismay she was feeling, she found herself more instead of less resolved to go ahead with the thing.<br><br>Her father had pointed out that as a service wife she might see exotic places and her share of excitement, but she&#x2019;d also never be able to put down roots or buy a house, and year after year she&#x2019;d get settled in one place and then have to disrupt her life and move to another. Her children would be dragged from school to school. Her husband would never earn what he could as a civilian. And most of all, the Air Force would always come first, and if that seemed too hard for her, then she&#x2019;d better back out now.<br><br>When her mother came into her bedroom a few nights later and asked if she really understood what she was getting herself into, Ellie said that she did. And when her mother scoffed at the idea that her Ellie would ever know why she did anything, Ellie said, &#x201c;At least I understand that about myself,&#x201d; and her mother answered, &#x201c;Well, what does that mean?&#x201d; and Ellie said she didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it anymore.<br><br>&#x201c;Now that we see you&#x2019;re not going to change your mind, we give up,&#x201d; her father announced a few days later, and she chose not to respond to that, either. His final word on the subject was that he hoped this Gordon realized just how selfish she could be. She lived with her parents for two more months before the wedding and they exchanged maybe ten words in total. Her mother&#x2019;s mother came for a visit and didn&#x2019;t congratulate Ellie on her news but did mention that the military was no place for a woman because the men drank too much and their wives had to raise their children in the unhealthiest climates. She offered as an example the Philippines, that sinkhole of malaria and vice.<br><br>They were married by a justice of the peace in Gordon&#x2019;s childhood home in Pasadena, and her parents came all the way out for the ceremony and left before the reception, their wedding present a card that read, &#x201c;Take care and all best wishes, Mom.&#x201d; The following week Gordon was posted to a base in upstate New York and Ellie spent a baffled month alone with his parents before taking the Air Force Wives&#x2019; Special across the country: Los Angeles to Boston for one hundred and forty dollars, with stops everywhere from Fresno to Providence and seats as hard as benches and twenty infants and children in her compartment alone. The women traveling solo helped out the most overwhelmed mothers, and Ellie spent the trip crawling under seats to retrieve crayons and shushing babies whose bottles were never the right temperature.<br><br>In upstate New York, the place Gordon found for her while they waited for quarters on the base was a rooming house that instead of fire escapes had ropes coiled beneath the bedroom windows. She had only a room to herself, with kitchen privileges. &#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s quiet,&#x201d; he told her when he first saw it, and then asked a few days later if her nightly headaches were related to what he&#x2019;d said about her room.<br><br>She was relieved that he mostly served his time on the base. Larry was born, and Gordon worked his way up to captain, and when in 1957 he was offered the command of some kind of new offshore platform, he wanted to request another assignment&#x2014;�what Air Force officer wanted to squat in a box over the ocean?&#x2014;�but told Ellie that it was her decision, too. &#x201c;You have a family now,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;I just want anything that keeps you closer.&#x201d; &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t get home any more often,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;And safer,&#x201d; she added. So after sleeping on it, he told her he&#x2019;d take the command, though afterward he was so disappointed that he wasn&#x2019;t himself for weeks.<br><br>By 1950 the Department of Defense had determined that the radar arrays carried on Navy picket ships and Air Force aircraft on station were not powerful enough to detect incoming Russian bombers sufficiently far offshore to enable fighter interception. The radar stations comprising the Distant Early Warning system across the far north of the continent provided some security in that direction, but given that nearly all of America&#x2019;s highest-�priority targets were situated inside its northeastern metropolitan corridor, protection from an attack across the Atlantic seemed both essential and entirely absent. In response, the Air Defense Command urgently ordered the construction of five platforms along the coast from Bangor to Atlantic City. The platforms were called Texas Towers because of their resemblance to oil rigs, were numbered from north to south, and cost eleven million dollars apiece.<br><br>They faced engineering problems as unprecedented as the space program&#x2019;s. Tower no. 4 in particular had presented a much greater challenge than the others since its footings would stand in 185 feet of water, more than three times as deep as the others. In 1955 the maximum depth at which anyone had built an undersea structure was sixty feet, and that had been in the Gulf of Mexico. Because of that, the Air Force had decided that this tower would require bold new thinking in its conception and hired a firm known for bridge design. The firm had had no experience at all in the area of ocean engineering for marine structures.<br><br>Tower no. 4 stood on three hollow legs nearly three hundred feet long. The legs were only twelve feet in diameter and braced by three submarine tiers of thirty-�inch steel struts, and topped with a triangular triple-�leveled platform that stood seventy feet above the waves. From its concrete footings on the seafloor to the top of its radomes it was the equivalent of a thirty-�story building out in the ocean.<br><br>Though oil-�drilling platforms had for the most part weathered the storms and seas of the Gulf, the Gulf at its worst was nothing like the North Atlantic.<br><br>And something was already wrong with Tower no. 4. Unlike the others, it moved so much in heavy weather or even a good strong wind that everyone who worked on it called it Old Shaky or the �Tiltin&#x2019; Hilton.<br><br>The first time Gordon set foot on it he&#x2019;d stood at the edge of the platform hanging on to the rope railings designed to catch those blown off their feet by wind gusts or prop wash, looked down into the waves so far below, and then out at the horizon, empty in all directions, and asked the officer he was relieving, &#x201c;What the hell am I doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>The tower housed seventy men. Besides crew and officer quarters and work stations it had a ward room, bakery, galley, mess, recreation area, and sick bay. Seven locomotive-�sized diesel engines provided electricity, and on the lower level ionizing machines converted salt water to drinking water. Fuel was stored in the hollow legs.<br><br>The crew was half Air Force and half civilian welders and electricians and technicians. For every thirty days on you got thirty days off. The military guys liked it because they got more time than they were used to with their families, but the civilians hated the isolation and complained they were always away for the big holidays, everybody seeming to be stuck out on the platform for New Year&#x2019;s and home for Groundhog Day.<br><br>But the tower shuddered and flexed so much in bad weather that whoever had painted &#x201c;Old Shaky&#x201d; over the door in the mess hall hadn&#x2019;t even been able to get the letters straight, and the floors moved so visibly in the winter that everyone was too seasick to eat. In his first phone call, Gordon told Ellie that the medic who&#x2019;d flown out with him hadn&#x2019;t even served out his first day; that when he saw how much the platform was pitching he refused to get off the helicopter and took it right back to shore on the next flight out. Once he left, Gordon found a crow hunkered down on the edge of the helipad, its tail feathers pummeled back in the wind. They got blown out here sometimes, the captain he was relieving had explained. Gordon boxed the crow up and carried it to his stateroom and made sure it was ferried back on the last copter out that night. &#x201c;Well, at least the crow is safe,&#x201d; Ellie told him. &#x201c;Unless he comes back,&#x201d; her husband answered.<br><br>Betty Bakke&#x2019;s husband, Roy, was a medic who hadn&#x2019;t insisted on flying back to the mainland the first time he&#x2019;d set foot on Tower no. 4, because he believed a man fulfilled his responsibilities. He&#x2019;d already made master sergeant and been nicknamed for his standard advice, as in &#x201c;I thought I was coming down with something but Don&#x2019;t Sweat It said I was okay.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d transferred from the Navy, where he&#x2019;d served on a minesweeper in Korea. The only thing that fazed him, he told Betty in his phone calls, was his separation from her. She and their boy were still stuck in their old bungalow in Mount Laguna on the other side of the country. Roy had put his friend and commanding officer, Gordon Phelan, on the phone during one call, and the captain had regaled her with stories about Roy. Roy had stayed on duty eighty straight hours with an airman second class who&#x2019;d had a heart attack, and was even better known for having stitched up his own eyebrow after a fall while everyone else watched. He&#x2019;d organized fishing contests off the deck and also radioed passing trawlers so the guys could trade their cigarettes and beer for fresh fish and lobster. On top of all of that, he&#x2019;d taken charge of the 16mm movies swapped from tower to tower and had scored big that Thanksgiving by having dealt The Vikings with Kirk Douglas for The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw with Jayne Mansfield.<br><br>Betty had told the captain that her husband sounded like a one-�man morale officer, and the captain said that was his point. And when Betty told him she&#x2019;d heard that long separations were the reefs that sank military marriages, the captain had laughed and said he was going to pass the phone back to her husband. &#x201c;Sounds like she needs a house call,&#x201d; she heard him say to Roy.<br><br>The Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks had advised the engineers that Tower no. 4&#x2019;s platform would need to withstand winds up to 125 miles per hour and breaking waves up to thirty-�five feet, based on twenty years&#x2019; worth of data provided by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. The main deck&#x2019;s planned seventy-�foot elevation should then provide plenty of clearance. A few members of the design team dissented, wishing to put on record their belief that wave heights and wind speeds should be calculated on the basis of what might be expected once a century rather than once every twenty years. They were outvoted.<br><br>To extend its radar coverage, Tower no. 4 had been given a location as close as possible to the edge of the continental shelf, which meant that just to its east the bottom dropped away thousands of feet and that waves coming from that direction or the north encountered that rising bottom and mounted themselves upward even higher. And in winter storms Tower no. 2, in much shallower water, had already recorded waves breaking over its deck.<br><br>But wait, Gordon told Ellie once he&#x2019;d done a little more research: the news got even worse. Because the footings were so deep, no. 4&#x2019;s hollow legs had been designed to be towed to their location, where they&#x2019;d be upended and anchored to the caissons on the bottom before the main deck was attached and raised. But because the legs were so long, the designers had had to use pin connections&#x2014;�giant bolts&#x2014;�rather than welds in the underwater braces. Though bolts were an innovative modification, they failed to take into account the constant yet random motions of the sea. For that reason, oil rigs and the other towers had used welded connections. The moment the bolts had gone in, they began generating impact stress around their connections. And Gordon had further discovered a storm had so pummeled two of the underwater braces during the towing that they&#x2019;d sheared off and sunk during the upending, and that everyone had then floated around until the Air Force finally gave the order to improvise repairs at sea to avoid having to haul the entire structure back to shore.<br><br>Then, in heavy swells, the five-�thousand-�ton platform kept smashing up against the legs, so reinforced steel had been flown out and welded over the damage.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I think it&#x2019;s time to put in for a change of assignment,&#x201d; Ellie told him in response. &#x201c;Yeah, well, in for a penny, in for a pound,&#x201d; he answered, by which she took him to mean, &#x201c;You got me into this, so I don&#x2019;t want to hear any complaints.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as the tower had gone operational, Wilbur Kovarick asked to be made its senior electrician so he could be closer to his family on Long Island, and Edna was so grateful that she kept him in bed the entire weekend.<br><br>By the time Edna had turned twenty-�six, all but two of her friends had married and she&#x2019;d been a bridesmaid five times.

By the time he called her she had no patience for pretense and told him to come right over, and when he appeared at her door she kissed him until he finally pulled away and she pressed her cheek to his and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not fast, I just know what I want,&#x201d; and after a moment he squeezed her even harder than she was squeezing him.

Through personal stories and 120 recipes, the book explores his classical training and traces his development as a creative superstar chef. Keller apprentices in a Michelin three star&#x2013;rated restaurant at the age of 16. He moves from his native Alsace, to southern France, and is inspired by the cuisine of the sun while working with the great French chefs of his time, Roger Verg�, Paul Bocuse, and Gaston Len�tre. He learns to adapt to challenging new environments in South America, and the United States, and charts his own path into the newest frontiers of the restaurant business. The book is organized by seminal themes in his life; it starts with his family in France, and ends back there in the&nbsp;&#x201c;Holiday&#x201d;&nbsp;chapter. The myriad recipes, which have been adapted for the home cook, are intertwined with 125 of Eric Wolfinger's luscious images of family and friends, food and cuisine, and the places and landscapes of France, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, which all make up chef Keller&#x2019;s life.</p><p><b>Hubert Keller</b>&nbsp;is known best for his world-renowned restaurants,&nbsp;<b>Fleur de Lys</b>&nbsp;(San Francisco, California),&nbsp;<b>Fleur by Hubert</b>&nbsp;<b>Keller&nbsp;</b>(Las Vegas, Nevada), and&nbsp;<b>Burger Bar</b>&nbsp;(San Francisco, Las Vegas, and St. Louis, Missouri).

It&#x2019;s here that his story (and recipes) begins. From each milestone in his life, which includes an apprenticeship at a top restaurant in France and time spent in South America, Keller offers a slew of relatively approachable recipes, most of which are fresh takes on traditional French cuisine, with small anecdotes that introduce each dish. Standouts include duck terrine and roasted lamb chops as well as such desserts as beignets, souffl�s, and an assortment of milkshakes. And although readers will surely rush to the kitchen to cook away, they may be left hungry to know more about Keller himself. --Casey Bayer</p><h2>Honest to God: Becoming Brutally Honest with a Gracious God</h2><p><p><b>Freedom begins when you stop hiding.</b></p><p>Many of us understand the value of authenticity.

Oldham, a twenty-year veteran New York Police Department detective now working as an investigator with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, had traveled across the country to arrest Stephen Caracappa and Louis Eppolito, two former NYPD detectives who had worked as hit men for the mafia in the eighties and early nineties. Across the street was Piero's, an upscale Italian restaurant decorated in a style known as Mob Vegas and frequented by local wiseguys as well as by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci during the filming of <i>Casino</i>. Oldham watched the exterior of the single-story restaurant patiently -- the red neon sign, the two attendants standing at the valet parking stand, the sun setting in the cloudless desert sky. Oldham could wait. He had been investigating Caracappa and Eppolito for seven years, the longest case of his career. Oldham was fifty-one years old, drank too much, depleted, done. For years no one else had worked the case against Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito. Oldham had refused to drop it. No investigation had demanded as much from him -- time, tenacity, every trick of the trade he'd acquired during a lifetime spent chasing criminals. If this was Oldham's longest and best case, it was also likely to be his last. </p><p> As Oldham watched, Caracappa and Eppolito pulled up to the valet parking area in an SUV with tinted windows, palmed the valet a few bucks, and walked toward the restaurant. Caracappa was dressed in a black pinstripe suit with wide lapels and a gold handkerchief tucked into the breast pocket. He walked with the self-conscious stride of a sixty-three-year-old mobbed-up dandy. Eppolito, a bodybuilder and a Mr. New York in his youth, was now nearly sixty and hugely overweight. He wore a tight-fitting double-breasted olive suit. He moved slowly but with a vestige of the strut he'd affected as a street cop. Oldham caught a glimpse of Eppolito's large gold-and-diamond pinkie ring with the NYPD detective shield embossed on it. Oldham hadn't seen either man in more than a decade, since he had worked with Detective Caracappa in the elite Major Case Squad. But Caracappa and Eppolito looked the same to him, just older and paler, dressed like aging gangsters. The two retired detectives had no idea they were about to be arrested. As far as they knew, they were going to a meeting with a Vegas accountant with underworld connections to talk about drug money to be used for financing a feature film about the mafia that Eppolito had written. </p><p> Before Caracappa and Eppolito reached the restaurant's door, Oldham put his rental car into gear and lurched across the avenue, pulling up behind the SUV, blocking its escape. Three chase cars from the Drug Enforcement Administration screeched to a halt and blocked the driveway. Four DEA agents planted in the vestibule of Piero's rushed the two from the entrance. At the briefing that morning, when the protocol for the takedown was planned, Oldham had urged the agents to be careful. The targets were in poor health, Oldham said. Eppolito had undergone open-heart surgery weeks earlier. Caracappa had only one lung remaining. Oldham wanted to be sure the agents didn't scare Caracappa and Eppolito to death before they had a chance to go to jail. At Piero's, Eppolito and Caracappa were sprawled against a wall within seconds. Two DEA agents took Eppolito and spread his hands against the wall. Patting him down, they found a stainless-steel .45 semiautomatic tucked into his waistband. Eppolito was plainly dazed and disoriented. Caracappa, the tougher of the two, was impassive as he raised his arms above his head and turned in a circle. Oldham went for Caracappa's ankle, where Oldham knew from their time together in the NYPD he kept a pistol. </p><p> "It's been a long time coming," one of the DEA agents said to Eppolito. </p><p> "Yes, it has," Eppolito replied. </p><p> The supervising DEA agent began to recite the charges against Caracappa and Eppolito, a formality Oldham had never heard before. He had made hundreds of arrests over the years, a number of them involving some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, but he had never experienced anything like this takedown. There was a theatrical aspect to it, the submachine guns, the dozen agents now swarming Piero's, the elaborate radio communications. The federal agents were triumphant, thrilled to be part of the arrest of the two dirtiest cops in the history of the NYPD. But Oldham had worked on the case far too long to feel elation. As a detective, he loved the chase. Capture brought out more complex feelings. Caracappa and Eppolito were "Steve" and "Louie" to Oldham -- fellow NYPD detectives, no matter the crimes they had committed. Now he watched the two being led away by federal agents. </p><p> As headlines around the world reported the next day, the two "Mafia Cops" were killers who had used their detective shields to facilitate their crimes. Caracappa and Eppolito were indicted on eight counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, obstruction of justice, kidnapping conspiracy, witness tampering, bribery, money laundering, and drug trafficking. The allegations defied belief. The detectives had been on the payroll of the mafia for more than ten years. Witnesses, cooperators, mobsters, and innocents had been murdered as a result of their criminal actions. Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito weren't beat cops. Caracappa had been one of the leading detectives in the forty-thousand-strong NYPD. He was an authority on organized crime, and had been assigned to the Organized Crime Homicide Unit. Amazingly, audaciously, he had been the self-appointed detective in charge of gathering intelligence and monitoring the activities of the Luchese crime family -- the very family for whom he secretly worked. Eppolito, a former detective in the 62nd and 63rd Precincts in mob-dominated sections of Brooklyn, claimed to be the eleventh most decorated cop in the history of the force. He was also the son of a Gambino "made man" and wore the heavy gold jewelry of a wiseguy while he was a detective. Eppolito had been accused and found not guilty in 1984 of providing police files to a Gambino capo under investigation -- an experience Eppolito described in detail in Mafia Cop, the book he wrote after retiring from the NYPD. For decades Eppolito flaunted his association with organized crime, proclaimed his innocence, and defended the honor of cosa nostra. Eppolito had even played a bit role as a mobster in the movie <i>GoodFellas</i> before attempting to make a career as an actor and writer specializing in mob tales. </p><p> The case against Caracappa and Eppolito dated back more than a decade. The investigation Oldham led had proven to be a complex weave of dogged detective work, patience, luck, and finally the persuasion of a criminal mastermind to turn against the two cops he "ran" for the mafia. Finding proof was maddening and irresistible -- evidence always seemed close enough to touch but just out of reach. Suspicions about the cops first crystallized in the spring of 1994 when Luchese underboss Anthony "Gaspipe" Casso "flipped" and started to cooperate with the federal government while in custody awaiting trial on multiple murder and racketeering counts. Casso explained the deal he had struck with Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito. In return for a "pad" of $4,000 a month, Casso told FBI agents and prosecutors, the two NYPD detectives had provided him information on law enforcement investigations and informants. Casso explained that he had also hired Caracappa and Eppolito as hit men, ultimately paying them more than $350,000 in total on behalf of the Luchese crime family. The money was paid through a go-between, a millionaire mob associate named Burton Kaplan. "The cops," as they were known to the leadership of the Luchese family, gave up snitches, tipped off raids, and shared the most sensitive police intelligence with the mob. Casso called Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito his "crystal ball" because they could foretell the future: who was informing, who was going to be arrested and indicted, who needed to be killed. </p><p> The allegations appeared in the New York tabloids in 1994, and became infamous in law enforcement circles. It was widely known throughout the NYPD that there had been leaks in a large number of organized crime investigations over the years. The problem was endemic, and deadly. The suspicions divided the department. Speculation circulated in all quarters about who might be responsible for the leaks. Theories ran the gamut, from mailroom employees in headquarters to detective squad commanders on Staten Island. Some detectives thought Caracappa or Eppolito were guilty. Some refused to believe that any of their brother officers would commit such crimes. Like many other cops at the time, Oldham assumed justice would be sure for Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito. Yet year after year, no charges were brought. Oldham watched as cases were started and abandoned. Incredibly, there were no methodical investigations of Casso's allegations -- not by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, or the NYPD itself. </p><p> Detectives Caracappa and Eppolito eventually retired to Las Vegas, to homes across the street from each other on a quiet cul-de-sac in a gated community -- each under the watchful gaze of the other. </p><p> They had appeared to have gotten away with murder -- they had "skated." </p><p> Finally in 1997, Oldham took up the case himself, figuring that if he didn't pursue Caracappa and Eppolito no one would. Working alone, for the most part, he gathered evidence and interviewed witnesses and chased down leads. Within months he was convinced that Caracappa and Eppolito were guilty. But there was a difference between knowing "the cops" were guilty and being able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The case held many mysteries.

This wasn't normal for Andy believe me, I know all the drunks in Bon Temps. Working at Sam Merlotte's bar for several years has pretty much introduced me to all of them. But Andy Bellefleur, native son and detective on Bon Temps's small police force, had never been drunk in Merlotte's before. I was mighty curious as to why tonight was an exception.<br><br>Andy and I aren't friends by any stretch of the imag-ination, so I couldn't ask him outright. But other means were open to me, and I decided to use them. Though I try to limit employing my disability, or gift, or whatever you want to call it, to find out things that might have an effect on me or mine, sometimes sheer curiosity wins out.<br><br>I let down my mental guard and read Andy's mind. I was sorry.<br><br>Andy had had to arrest a man that morning for kid-napping. He'd taken his ten-year-old neighbor to a place in the woods and raped her. The girl was in the hospital, and the man was in jail, but the damage that had been dealt was irreparable. I felt weepy and sad. It was a crime that touched too closely on my own past. I liked Andy a little better for his depression.<br><br> "Andy Bellefleur, give me your keys," I said. His broad face turned up to me, showing very little compre-hension. After a long pause while my meaning filtered through to his addled brain, Andy fumbled in the pocket of his khakis and handed me his heavy key ring. I put another bourbon-and-Coke on the bar in front of him. "My treat," I said, and went to the phone at the end of the bar to call Portia, Andy's sister. The Bellefleur sib-lings lived in a decaying large white two-story antebel-lum, formerly quite a showplace, on the prettiest street in the nicest area of Bon Temps. On Magnolia Creek Road, all the homes faced the strip of park through which ran the stream, crossed here and there by deco-rative bridges for foot traffic only; a road ran on both sides. There were a few other old homes on Magnolia Creek Road, but they were all in better repair than the Bellefleur place, Belle Rive. Belle Rive was just too much for Portia, a lawyer, and Andy, a cop, to maintain, since the money to support such a home and its grounds was long since gone. But their grandmother, Caroline, stubbornly refused to sell.<br><br>Portia answered on the second ring.<br><br> "Portia, this is Sookie Stackhouse," I said, having to raise my voice over the background noise in the bar.<br><br> "You must be at work."<br><br> "Yes. Andy's here, and he's three sheets to the wind. I took his keys. Can you come get him?"<br><br> "Andy had too much to drink? That's rare. Sure, I'll be there in ten minutes," she promised, and hung up.<br><br> "You're a sweet girl, Sookie," Andy volunteered un-expectedly.<br><br>He'd finished the drink I'd poured for him. I swept the glass out of sight and hoped he wouldn't ask for more. "Thanks, Andy," I said. "You're okay, yourself."<br><br> "Where'sboyfriend?"<br><br> "Right here," said a cool voice, and Bill Compton appeared just behind Andy. I smiled at him over Andy's drooping head. Bill was about five foot ten, with dark brown hair and eyes. He had the broad shoulders and hard muscular arms of a man who's done manual labor for years. Bill had worked a farm with his father, and then for himself, before he'd gone to be a soldier in the war. That would be the Civil War.<br><br> "Hey, B.!" called Charlsie Tooten's husband, Mi-cah. Bill raised a casual hand to return the greeting, and my brother, Jason, said, "Evening, Vampire Bill," in a perfectly polite way. Jason, who had not exactly wel-comed Bill into our little family circle, had turned over a whole new leaf. I was sort of mentally holding my breath, waiting to see if his improved attitude was per-manent.<br><br> "Bill, you're okay for a bloodsucker," Andy said ju-diciously, rotating on his bar stool so he could face Bill. I upgraded my opinion of Andy's drunkenness, since he had never otherwise been enthusiastic about the accep-tance of vampires into America's mainstream society.<br><br> "Thanks," Bill said dryly. "You're not too bad for a Bellefleur." He leaned across the bar to give me a kiss. His lips were as cool as his voice. You had to get used to it. Like when you laid your head on his chest, and you didn't hear a heartbeat inside. "Evening, sweet-heart," he said in his low voice. I slid a glass of the Japanese-developed synthetic B negative across the bar, and he knocked it back and licked his lips. He looked pinker almost immediately.<br><br> "How'd your meeting go, honey?" I asked. Bill had been in Shreveport the better part of the night.<br><br> "I'll tell you later."<br><br>I hoped his work-related story was less distressing than Andy's. "Okay. I'd appreciate it if you'd help Por-tia get Andy to her car. Here she comes now," I said, nodding toward the door.<br><br>For once, Portia was not wearing the skirt, blouse, jacket, hose, and low-heeled pumps that constituted her professional uniform. She'd changed to blue jeans and a ragged Sophie Newcomb sweatshirt. Portia was built as squarely as her brother, but she had long, thick, chest-nut hair. Keeping it beautifully tended was Portia's one signal that she hadn't given up yet. She plowed single-mindedly through the rowdy crowd.<br><br> "Well, he's soused, all right," she said, evaluating her brother. Portia was trying to ignore Bill, who made her very uneasy. "It doesn't happen often, but if he decides to tie one on, he does a good job."<br><br> "Portia, Bill can carry him to your car," I said. Andy was taller than Portia and thick in body, clearly too much of a burden for his sister. <br><br> "I think I can handle him," she told me firmly, still not looking toward Bill, who raised his eyebrows at me. <br><br>So I let her get one arm around him and try to hoist him off the stool. Andy stayed perched. Portia glanced around for Sam Merlotte, the bar owner, who was small and wiry in appearance but very strong. "Sam's bar-tending at an anniversary party at the country club," I said. "Better let Bill help." <br><br> "All right," the lawyer said stiffly, her eyes on the polished wood of the bar. "Thanks very much." <br><br>Bill had Andy up and moving toward the door in sec-onds, in spite of Andy's legs tending to turn to jelly. Micah Tooten jumped up to open the door, so Bill was able to sweep Andy right out into the parking lot. <br><br> "Thanks, Sookie," Portia said. "Is his bar tab settled up?" <br><br>I nodded. <br><br> "Okay," she said, slapping her hand on the bar to signal she was out of there. She had to listen to a chorus of well-meant advice as she followed Bill out the front door of Merlotte's. <br><br>That was how Detective Andy Bellefleur's old Buick came to sit in the parking lot at Merlotte's all night and into the next day. The Buick had certainly been empty when Andy had gotten out to enter the bar, he would later swear. He'd also testify that he'd had been so pre-occupied by his internal turmoil that he'd forgotten to lock the car. <br><br>At some point between eight o'clock, when Andy had arrived at Merlotte's, and ten the next morning, when I arrived to help open the bar, Andy's car acquired a new passenger. <br><br>This one would cause considerable embarrassment for the policeman. <br><br> This one was dead.<br><br>I shouldn't have been there at all. I'd worked the late shift the night before, and I should've worked the late shift again that night. But Bill had asked me if I could switch with one of my coworkers, because he needed me to accompany him to Shreveport, and Sam hadn't objected. I'd asked my friend Arlene if she'd work my shift. She was due a day off, but she always wanted to earn the better tips we got at night, and she agreed to come in at five that afternoon. <br><br>By all rights, Andy should've collected his car that morning, but he'd been too hung over to fool with get-ting Portia to run him over to Merlotte's, which was out of the way to the police station. She'd told him she would pick him up at work at noon, and they'd eat lunch at the bar. Then he could retrieve his car. <br><br>So the Buick, with its silent passenger, waited for dis-covery far longer than it should have. <br><br>I'd gotten about six hours' sleep the night before, so I was feeling pretty good. Dating a vampire can be hard on your equilibrium if you're truly a daytime person, like me. I'd helped close the bar, and left for home with Bill by one o'clock. We'd gotten in Bill's hot tub to-gether, then done other things, but I'd gotten to bed by a little after two, and I didn't get up until almost nine. Bill had long been in the ground by then. <br><br>I drank lots of water and orange juice and took a multivitamin and iron supplement for breakfast, which was my regimen since Bill had come into my life and brought (along with love, adventure, and excitement) the constant threat of anemia. The weather was getting cooler, thank God, and I sat on Bill's front porch wear-ing a cardigan and the black slacks we wore to work at Merlotte's when it was too cool for shorts. My white golf shirt had merlotte's bar embroidered on the left breast. <br><br>As I skimmed the morning paper, with one part of my mind I was recording the fact that the grass was defi-nitely not growing as fast. Some of the leaves appeared to be beginning to turn. The high school football stadium might be just about tolerable this coming Friday night. <br><br>The summer just hates to let go in Louisiana, even northern Louisiana. Fall begins in a very halfhearted way, as though it might quit at any minute and revert to the stifling heat of July. But I was on the alert, and I could spot traces of fall this morning. Fall and winter meant longer nights, more time with Bill, more hours of sleep. <br><br>So I was cheerful when I went to work. When I saw the Buick sitting all by its lonesome in front of the bar, I remembered Andy's surprising binge the night before. I have to confess, I smiled when I thought of how he'd be feeling today. Just as I was about to drive around in back and park with the other employees, I noticed that Andy's rear passenger door was open just a little bit. That would make his dome light stay on, surely? And his battery would run down. And he'd be angry, and have to come in the bar to call the tow truck, or ask someone to jump him so I put my car in park and slid out, leaving it running. That turned out to be an optimistic error. <br><br>I shoved the door to, but it would only give an inch. So I pressed my body to it, thinking it would latch and I could be on my way. Again, the door would not click shut. Impatiently, I yanked it all the way open to find out what was in the way. A wave of smell gusted out into the parking lot, a dreadful smell. Dismay clutched at my throat, because the smell was not unknown to me. I peered into the backseat of the car, my hand covering my mouth, though that hardly helped with the smell. <br><br> "Oh, man," I whispered. "Oh, shit." Lafayette, the cook for one shift at Merlotte's, had been shoved into the backseat. He was naked. It was Lafayette's thin brown foot, its toenails painted a deep crimson, that had kept the door from shutting, and it was Lafayette's corpse that smelled to high heaven. <br><br>I backed away hastily, then scrambled into my car and drove around back behind the bar, blowing my horn. Sam came running out of the employee door, an apron tied around his waist. I turned off my car and was out of it so quick I hardly realized I'd done it, and I wrapped myself around Sam like a static-filled sock. <br><br>"What is it?" Sam's voice said in my ear. I leaned back to look at him, not having to gaze up too much since Sam is a smallish man. His reddish gold hair was gleaming in the morning sun. He has true-blue eyes, and they were wide with apprehension. <br><br>"It's Lafayette," I said, and began crying. That was ridiculous and silly and no help at all, but I couldn't help it. "He's dead, in Andy Bellefleur's car." <br><br>Sam's arms tightened behind my back and drew me into his body once more. "Sookie, I'm sorry you saw it," he said. "We'll call the police. Poor Lafayette." <br><br>Being a cook at Merlotte's does not exactly call for any extraordinary culinary skill, since Sam just offers a few sandwiches and fries, so there's a high turnover. But Lafayette had lasted longer than most, to my surprise. Lafayette had been gay, flamboyantly gay, makeup-and-long-fingernails gay. People in northern Louisiana are less tolerant of that than New Orleans people, and I ex-pect Lafayette, a man of color, had had a doubly hard time of it. Despite or because of his difficulties, he was cheerful, entertainingly mischievous, clever, and ac-tually a good cook. He had a special sauce he steeped hamburgers in, and people asked for Burgers Lafayette pretty regular. <br><br> "Did he have family here?" I asked Sam. We eased apart self-consciously and went into the building, to Sam's office. <br><br> "He had a cousin," Sam said, as his fingers punched 9-1-1. "Please come to Merlotte's on Hummingbird Road," he told the dispatcher. "There's a dead man in a car here. Yes, in the parking lot, in the front of the place. Oh, and you might want to alert Andy Bellefleur. It's his car." <br><br>I could hear the squawk on the other end of the line from where I stood. <br><br>Danielle Gray and Holly Cleary, the two waitresses on the morning shift, came through the back door laugh-ing. Both divorced women in their mid-twenties, Danielle and Holly were lifelong friends who seemed to be quite happy working their jobs as long as they were together. Holly had a five-year-old son who was at kindergarten, and Danielle had a seven-year-old daughter and a boy too young for school, who stayed with Danielle's mother while Danielle was at Merlotte's. I would never be any closer to the two women who, after all, were around my age because they were careful to be sufficient unto themselves. <br><br> "What's the matter?" Danielle asked when she saw my face. Her own, narrow and freckled, became in-stantly worried. <br><br>"Why's Andy's car out front?" Holly asked. She'd dated Andy Bellefleur for a while, I recalled. Holly had short blond hair that hung around her face like wilted daisy petals, and the prettiest skin I'd ever seen. "He spend the night in it?" <br><br> "No," I said, "but someone else did." <br><br> "Who?" <br><br> "Lafayette's in it." <br><br> "Andy let a black queer sleep in his car?" This was Holly, who was the blunt straightforward one. <br><br> "What happened to him?" This was Danielle, who was the smarter of the two. <br><br> "We don't know," Sam said. "The police are on the way." <br><br> "You mean," Danielle said, slowly and carefully, "that he's dead." <br><br>"Yes," I told her. "That's exactly what we mean." <br><br> "Well, we're set to open in an hour." Holly's hands settled on her round hips. "What are we gonna do about that? If the police let us open, who's gonna cook for us? People come in, they'll want lunch." <br><br> "We better get ready, just in case," Sam said. "Though I'm thinking we won't get to open until sometime this afternoon." He went into his office to begin calling sub-stitute cooks. <br><br>It felt strange to be going about the opening routine, just as if Lafayette were going to mince in any minute with a story about some party he'd been to, the way he had a few days before. The sirens came shrieking down the county road that ran in front of Merlotte's. Cars crunched across Sam's gravel parking lot. By the time we had the chairs down, the tables set, and extra silver-ware rolled in napkins and ready to replace used settings, the police came in. <br><br>Merlotte's is out of the city limits, so the parish sher-iff, Bud Dearborn, would be in charge. Bud Dearborn, who'd been a good friend of my father's, was gray-haired now. He had a mashed-in face, like a human Pe-kinese, and opaque brown eyes. A...</p><h2>Beyond The Visible: The Art Of Odilon Redon</h2><p>Caught between description and dream, the felt and the imagined, French artist Odilon Redon, whose career bridged the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, transformed the natural world into nightmarish visions and bizarre fantasies. Closely allied with the Symbolist movement, Redon offered his own interpretations of literary, biblical and mythological subjects; created a universe of strange hybrid creatures; and presented landscape in a singular way: we see grinning disembodied teeth, smiling spiders, melancholic floating faces, winged chariots, unfamiliar plant life, and velvety black or colored swirls of atmosphere. With a recent gift from the Ian Woodner family, The Museum of Modern Art is now the site of the most significant body of the artist&#39;s work outside France, and this book will showcase the full range of Redon&#39;s varied oeuvre--charcoal &#34;noirs,&#34; luminous pastels, richly textured canvases, literary collaborations and experiments in printmaking--and will illuminate the hold his particular kind of Modernism has had on both twentieth-century and contemporary artists.</p><p></p><h2>If I&#39;d Killed Him When I Met Him...</h2><p>"Whenever Sharyn McCrumb suits up her amateur detective, Elizabeth MacPherson, it's pretty certain that a trip is in the offing and that something deadly funny will happen on the road." <br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>Now, the author of She Walks These Hills brings her storytelling gifts to a novel about crimes committed a century apart.<br>For forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson, solving mysteries hardly seems the fun it used to be--even if she is the official private investigator for her brother Bill's fledgling Virginia law firm.

I thought as she were &#x2019;andmade for the job, like, but this mornin&#x2019; you&#x2019;d&#x2019;a thought she&#x2019;d got left at the altar. All weepin&#x2019; an&#x2019; can&#x2019;t believe it, like.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester was stunned. When she had hired Josephine a few weeks earlier, the girl had said she was not courting and had no intention of giving up nursing in any imaginable future.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is she? Do you know?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We got someone in all beat up, blood everywhere. She&#x2019;ll be seein&#x2019; to &#x2019;er,&#x201d; Ruby replied. &#x201c;That were &#x2019;alf an hour ago, mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Hester went through the far door and along the passageway, asking after Josephine each time she encountered someone. In the old pantry where they kept medical supplies she finally found her, moving between the shelves, counting and sorting. She was a pretty girl, perhaps too much character in her face to be conventionally beautiful. Now her cheeks were stained with tears, her eyes were blank, and her lips were pressed so tight the muscles were visible along her jaw and in her neck. It was clear that she did not even hear Hester come in.<br><br>Hester closed the door to give them complete privacy before she spoke. As always, she was direct. Medicine, she had found, was not an art that allowed for much roundabout conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asked gently.<br><br>Startled, Josephine swung round to face Hester. She was blinking rapidly as the uncontrolled tears slid down her face.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;ll . . . I&#x2019;ll be all right in a moment.&#x201d; She was clearly ashamed at being caught giving way to her distress, whatever it was.<br><br>Hester put her hand ever so gently on Josephine&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Something must be very wrong for you to be so upset by it. You&#x2019;ve seen terrible wounds and nursed the dying. Something that hurts you so much isn&#x2019;t going to be dealt with in a few minutes. Tell me what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine shook her head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help with this,&#x201d; she answered, her voice choking in her throat. &#x201c;I . . . I need to work. Really . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Hester did not loosen her grip.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing that anyone can do,&#x201d; Josephine repeated, still attempting to pull away.<br><br>Hester hesitated. Would it be intrusive if she insisted? She liked this young woman on a deep, instinctive level; she reminded Hester of herself, years ago. And Hester knew exactly the pain and loneliness one felt when starting out in the profession. She had felt the overwhelming sense of helplessness that comes when witnessing the realities of physical agony and death, the moment when things go beyond anyone&#x2019;s reach and all you can do is watch. All that, on top of the ordinary heartache of life and youth&#x2014;it had been a difficult burden to bear when she was younger. Even now, at times.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me anyway,&#x201d; she said gently.<br><br>Josephine hesitated, and then straightened herself with an effort. She swallowed hard and fished for a handkerchief to blow her nose.<br><br>Hester waited, leaving the door closed. No one else could come in without a key.<br><br>&#x201c;My mother died a long time ago,&#x201d; Josephine began. &#x201c;My father and I have become very close.&#x201d; She took a deep breath and tried to keep her voice level, almost emotionless, as if she were recounting figures in a calculation, something with no personal weight. &#x201c;He has been going to a Nonconformist church for just over a year now. He found many friends among the congregation. He said there was a degree of warmth in it that appealed to him more than the ritual of the Church of England, which he found . . . cold.&#x201d; She swallowed hard again.<br><br>Hester did not interrupt. So far there was nothing odd, let alone disastrous, in what Josephine was saying. She hadn&#x2019;t known Josephine long, but the girl did not strike her as the type to care exactly which religion her father followed, as long as it was broadly Christian, so that couldn&#x2019;t be the cause of her distress.<br><br>Josephine took another shaky breath. &#x201c;He told me that they do a great deal of good work, both here in England and abroad. They need money to provide food, medicines, clothes, and so on, for those in desperate circumstances.&#x201d; She searched Hester&#x2019;s face for understanding.<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds a very Christian thing to do.&#x201d; Hester filled in the silence. Then a thought occurred to her. &#x201c;Oh dear&#x2014;did your father discover that was not what they were using the money for?&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine looked startled. &#x201c;Oh no! No, it wasn&#x2019;t that. They just . . . they wanted so much! They pressured him for more and more. He is not a wealthy man, but he always speaks well, dresses well . . . if you know what I mean? Perhaps they thought he was wealthier than he is . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Hester began to understand where this might lead.<br><br>Josephine was watching her intently now. Her voice wavered. &#x201c;They kept on asking him, and he was embarrassed to decline. It isn&#x2019;t easy to say you can&#x2019;t afford any more, especially when they tell you people are starving, and you know that you can eat whenever you wish, even if it is a modest meal.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester looked at the pain in the young woman&#x2019;s face, in her eyes, at the clenched hands gripping the handkerchief. She seemed frightened, embarrassed, and racked with sadness.<br><br>&#x201c;They pressed him into giving them much more than he could afford?&#x201d; Hester asked quietly.<br><br>Josephine nodded, her jaw clenched hard to help her control the emotion that welled up inside her.<br><br>&#x201c;Is the debt serious?&#x201d; Hester continued.<br><br>Josephine nodded again, the hopelessness clear in her face. She looked down, as if to avoid the condemnation she obviously expected to see in Hester&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Hester was overwhelmed by a sudden, wrenching memory of her own father, as she had seen him before she left for the Crimea, a dozen years ago, when this young woman was but a child. He had been so proud of her, seeing her off on a noble enterprise. She could smell the salt on the wind again, hear the gulls crying and the creak of ropes as the ship rose and fell, straining against its moorings.<br><br>That was the last time she had ever seen him. The reasons for his falling into debt had been different than Mr. Raleigh&#x2019;s reasons, even if they had also been tied to his compassion and sense of honor; but the pain his debt caused his family was the same. He too had been pressured and then cheated. The shame of it had caused him to take his own life. Hester had been away in the Crimea, nursing men she did not even know, and her family had faced that grief without her. Her mother had been almost unable to bear it and died shortly after the news of her second son&#x2019;s death in the Crimea reached her.<br><br>Hester had arrived home in England to face her one remaining brother&#x2019;s bereavement and his fury that she had not been there when she was so badly needed, that she had spent her time and her pity on strangers instead.<br><br>They were still distant, no more between them than the occasional exchange of Christmas cards, the odd stiff letter in formal language now and then.<br><br>Hester understood sorrow, guilt, helplessness, and the lethal burden of debt more intimately than Josephine Raleigh could have imagined.<br><br>She realized that Josephine was gazing at her now, confused. She felt foolish for drifting off into her own memories.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said gently. &#x201c;I was thinking of someone I loved . . . someone who also suffered, in a similar way. I wasn&#x2019;t able to help him because I was in the Crimea with the army. I didn&#x2019;t come home until it was too late. How deep is your father&#x2019;s debt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; Josephine said quietly. &#x201c;Much more than he can pay. I&#x2019;ve given him everything I have, but it&#x2019;s far too late. And I can&#x2019;t earn enough to&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped. There was no point in explaining what was so obvious.<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s mind raced, searching for something to say that might help; her painful memories still churned, the hopelessness, the despair of being too late to help, and the ache she still felt to turn back time and do everything differently. When she spoke her voice was husky. &#x201c;I imagine these people ask every member of the congregation whom they think might have anything to give to donate?&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine gulped. &#x201c;Yes . . . I . . . I think so.&#x201d;<br><br>Footsteps sounded in the passage outside, hesitated, then went on.<br><br>&#x201c;Well. Maybe there is something dishonest about the whole thing,&#x201d; Hester said thoughtfully. &#x201c;To pressure people that way isn&#x2019;t . . . right . . . even if it&#x2019;s not illegal. Maybe there was a reason. I don&#x2019;t know. I will ask my husband. He is a police officer. There might be something we can do.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine&#x2019;s face filled with distress. &#x201c;Oh no! Please don&#x2019;t . . . my father would be mortified! The shame would be&#x2014;&#x201d; She gulped again and all but choked. &#x201c;It would make him look as if he were . . . reluctant to have given charity to those in far more need than any of us. It would be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Josephine!&#x201d; Hester said quickly, feeling the heat wash up her face. &#x201c;Of course I wouldn&#x2019;t reveal his name or his circumstances to anyone. I have no intention of being so clumsy. I am aware that would humiliate him.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine shook her head. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes I do,&#x201d; Hester replied. She took a minute to weigh her next words before continuing. &#x201c;The man I was thinking of a minute ago was my own father. I think the shame of what happened to him was what killed him. So I do understand. I shall look into this as far as I can, without mentioning any names, I promise you.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine was still uncertain. &#x201c;If he finds out, he will think I&#x2019;ve betrayed him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t know anything of it,&#x201d; Hester promised again. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think he would want to prevent others from suffering in the same way? And for that matter, I would be surprised if he is the only one of the congregation in this position. Wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I suppose so. But how will you do it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet. Perhaps I will have no clear idea until I try,&#x201d; Hester admitted. &#x201c;But if people are being forced into this position, it must be stopped.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine gave a very slight smile. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester smiled back at her. &#x201c;Where is this church, and what is the name of the man who leads it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Abel Taft is his name. The church is on the corner of Wilmington Square and Yardley Street,&#x201d; Josephine replied, frowning. &#x201c;But you live on the south side of the river, miles away! How will you explain going to a church up there?&#x201d;<br><br>Hester smiled more widely. &#x201c;Their reputation for true and active Christianity, of course!&#x201d; she replied sarcastically.<br><br>Josephine laughed in spite of herself, and tears of gratitude filled her eyes. She shook herself abruptly, straightened her shoulders, and smoothed the skirt of the gray dress. &#x201c;I have work to do,&#x201d; she said more steadily. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all behind myself.&#x201d;<br><br>There were times, especially in the winter, when William Monk found his duties as commander of the Thames River Police to be more arduous than usual. The knife-edge of ice on the wind across the open water could cut through almost anything, except oilskins. It whipped the flesh raw on exposed cheeks and froze the heavy cloth of trouser legs when the rain or the river water dampened them.<br><br>But this late spring evening was balmy, and over the shining water arched a pale blue, almost cloudless sky. The breeze was welcome, the tide was high, and there were no naked banks exposed, which meant there was no dank smell of mud. Pleasure boats passed by with colored banners waving, laughter drifting toward the shore where a hurdy-gurdy played a popular song from the current music-hall shows. All the warm hope of summer lay ahead. It was a perfect time to be finishing a patrol on the river and thinking of going home.<br><br>Monk had always managed a boat easily. It was one of the skills from his forgotten past, although his memory of how he acquired the ability had been obliterated by an injury in a carriage crash, just before he had first met Hester, nine years ago, in 1856. It always fascinated him that the mind could erase all sorts of things that the body seemed to recall.<br><br>With ease he brought the police boat to the bottom of the dock steps, shipped the oars, and stepped out with the mooring rope in his hand. He tied it loosely so that later on the receding water would not strain it and walked up the steps to make his final report at the station.<br><br>He spoke briefly with Orme, his second in command, made a last check of everything else, and half an hour later he was back on the water again&#x2014;this time as passenger in a ferry as it approached the dock at Princes Stairs, on the south bank at Rotherhithe.<br><br>He paid the fare and walked up the hill toward his home on Paradise Place, the panorama of the Pool of London behind him, black masts and cross spars against the fading sky, water still as polished silk.<br><br>He found Hester in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove, and Scuff, the onetime mudlark they had adopted&#x2014;or, more accurately who had adopted them&#x2014;sitting hopefully at the table, waiting for supper. He had been more or less resident for nearly two years now and was beginning to take them rather more for granted, as if finally he had accepted that this was his home, that they would not suddenly change their minds and turn him out back onto the dockside.<br><br>He had grown considerably since they had taken him in. There was a lot of difference between a half-starved boy of eleven&#x2014;Scuff&#x2019;s own estimate of his age, though they couldn&#x2019;t confirm it&#x2014;and a boy of thirteen, who eats at every possible opportunity, mealtimes or not. He was several inches taller and was beginning to appear less angular; he no longer looked as if a sharp twist would break his bones.<br><br>He was also beginning to acquire a rather self-conscious dignity. Instead of unabashed pleasure, he now welcomed Monk with a grin, but remained seated, far too grown up to give away his emotions.<br><br>Smiling to himself, Monk acknowledged Scuff equally casually and went over to Hester to give a much warmer and completely spontaneous greeting. They spoke of the day and its events. Scuff reported on his time at school, an experience that was only slowly becoming familiar to him. It had not been easy; he had always been able to count, and he knew the value of money to the farthing.</p><h2>Suivez La Piste: A Detective Thriller in French in 25 Short Episodes (English and French Edition)</h2><p>'Suivez La Piste' is a detective thriller based on a television French language course produced by the BBC.

Two men, foreign contractors from the same company, are sent to finish the highway.

He was lying on a plastic mattress, in a converted shipping container, below a tiny fan that circulated the&nbsp; room&#x2019;s tepid air. <br><br> He washed himself with packaged towelettes and put on his uniform, a black jumpsuit of synthetic fiber. Under a quickly rising sun he walked across the hotel&#x2019;s gravel courtyard to his partner&#x2019;s room. They had never met. He knocked on the corrugated steel door. There was no answer. He knocked louder. <br><br> After some shuffling from within, a lithesome man answered, naked but for a pair of white boxers. He had dark eyes, a cleft chin and a wide mouth ringed with full, womanly lips. A swirl of black hair rakishly obscured his left eye. <br><br> &#x201c;Pick a number.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nine,&#x201d; the man at the door said, smiling slyly.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay. You know how the company handles names. I don&#x2019;t know yours, you don&#x2019;t know mine. For the next two weeks, you&#x2019;re Nine. Call me Four.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Four?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will call me Four. I&#x2019;ll call you Nine. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br> For reasons of security, the company insisted on simple pseudonyms, usually numerical.<br><br> &#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; Nine said, and swept his hair from his face and threw it back.<br><br> They had arrived without passports. Passports were complications and liabilities in such a place, a nation recovering from years of civil war, riddled with corruption and burdened now by a new and lawless government. Four and Nine had been flown in under assumed names on a private charter. In the past, in other nations, the company&#x2019;s employees had been ransomed and killed. The kidnappers went first for their quarry&#x2019;s company, then family, then nation. But without passports or names, men like Four and Nine were anonymous and of little value. Their machine, the RS-80, was almost impossible to trace. It bore no company name, no serial number and had no national registry. No one but their clients, the north�ern government in the capital, would know anything about them, their origins or employer.<br><br> &#x201c;You ready to eat?&#x201d; Four asked. &#x201c;We have forty minutes till we begin. The crew is making a final check on the machine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; Nine said, a smile overtaking his expansive mouth. Nine stepped out of the doorway and tilted his head toward the bed behind him.<br><br> Beyond Nine&#x2019;s naked torso Four could see the fur�rowed sheets of an unmade bed, and woven within them the muscular legs of a sleeping woman. Nine made no effort to hide her. Instead he smiled conspiratorially. Four had never met this man, and did not think himself capable of prophecy, but in an instant he knew Nine was an agent of chaos and would make the difficult work ahead far more so.<br><br> Now Nine yawned. &#x201c;Can I meet you in a few minutes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Four closed the door and made his way across the courtyard, now baking in the day&#x2019;s young heat, to the cafeteria. The room was humid with men bent over their food&#x2014;men in suits, men in faded military uniforms, men in traditional dress. All spoke in low voices over the clacking of cheap tin silverware on plastic plates.<br><br> There were only a few foreigners in the makeshift din�ing hall attached to this new hotel, comprising two dozen shipping containers arranged in an untidy semicircle. After waiting half an hour in the breakfast room, Four went to Nine&#x2019;s room again and knocked on the door.<br><br> &#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; Nine yelled, and the room burst with laughter.<br><br> Four returned to the cafeteria and drank bottled water. Ten minutes later Nine entered the room, having showered and dressed in his company-issued black jump�suit. He had, though, declined to insert himself into the suit&#x2019;s upper half. He wore a white V-neck undershirt, the jumpsuit&#x2019;s sleeves dangling limply by his side, petting the other men&#x2019;s shoulders as he slipped around the tables on his way to Four.<br><br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect you here today,&#x201d; Nine said. &#x201c;The planes in these parts aren&#x2019;t so punctual. That&#x2019;s why I had company last night. You married?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Four lied.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not eating?&#x201d; Nine asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I already ate,&#x201d; Four said. In his room, he had finished a packet of dry oatmeal and powdered milk, a bag of almonds and a length of venison jerky&#x2014;all of which he had brought with him. He had packed enough food for the twelve days the job was expected to take.<br><br> &#x201c;You ate in your <i>room</i>?&#x201d; Nine said, offended. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do <i>that. </i>The food here&#x2019;s so good. Well, it&#x2019;s not so good, but it&#x2019;s <i>intriguing.</i>&#x201d; His hair had fallen over his left eye and he flung it back with a flourish of his hand.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get to it,&#x201d; Nine said, and went to the buffet and chose half a grapefruit, a tall glass of mango juice, three boiled eggs and a few shards of animal bone covered in purple meat. On his way back to the table, Nine&#x2019;s lifeless sleeves again flailed amid the other diners. Four looked around the room to see if any of the local men, a mix of former rebel commanders and recent profiteers, had taken an interest in Four or Nine. None had. He and his new partner were obviously foreigners in a place where most visitors were aid workers and arms inspectors, and it was better if they remained unmemorable.<br><br> Nine set his plate down and allowed his hair to fall from his forehead like the tendrils of a willow. Eschewing the tin utensils, Nine used his fingers to bring the gamey bones to his mouth for gnawing and washed the meat down with sun-colored juice. The company had advised against eating regional fruit in whole or liquid form, and strongly suggested that eggs or meat could contain <i>E. coli, </i>salmonella or ringworm. But Nine was devouring it all with abandon, his greasy hair groping his plate obscenely. Four could not discern what the company saw in this man. He was a liability.<br><br> &#x201c;You know what she cost?&#x201d; Nine asked, his mouth full. He did not wait for Four to answer. &#x201c;Less than what we&#x2019;re paying for breakfast. And she was fresher than this,&#x201d; he said, jabbing his fork at the wet grapefruit before him.<br><br> &#x201c;The machine&#x2019;s waiting,&#x201d; Four said. &#x201c;The first pod is in place. How long until you&#x2019;re ready?&#x201d;<br><br> Nine looked at him, grinning. &#x201c;Now I know why they call you the Clock.&#x201d;<br><br> Four stood. &#x201c;Be ready in ten minutes,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious. I just got in yesterday,&#x201d; Nine said. &#x201c;The schedule&#x2019;s padded. This is a great town. Let&#x2019;s spend a day here. Another night, more importantly.&#x201d; He raised an eyebrow lewdly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll loan you my girl.&#x201d;<br><br> Four pushed in his chair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you out front in ten minutes. Bring all your gear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>The Year Of Secret Assignments</h2><p>Three girls. Three boys. One of them's a total psycho.<br>It's teenage life as it really feels.

He lives in Los Angeles, California. Author website: lgoldberg.com.Based on the USA Network show Monk, Goldberg's fourth Adrian Monk novel, the first in hardcover (after Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu), fails to master the many challenges that television adaptations face. The books share the show's sparseness of plot, without the charm of Tony Shalhoub's Emmy-winning portrayal of the obsessive-compulsive genius sleuth. Goldberg's wrinkle this time is to partner Monk's first assistant, Sharona Fleming, whose husband, Trevor, is in prison for murder, with her successor, Natalie Teeger, a widowed California soccer mom who narrates the tale. Natalie is anxious that Sharona might supplant her, a concern not allayed when Monk asks both women to work for him part-time. The puzzle centering on Trevor is fairly thin, and Goldberg throws in several shorter mysteries for Monk to solve almost instantly. While it might have been too much to expect a book from Monk's perspective, even within the confines of Natalie-as-narrator, more could have been done. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She also couldn't hear. And, unfortunately, in the early nineteenth century in America, there was no way to teach deaf children. One day, though, an equally curious young man named Thomas Gallaudet, Alice's neighbor, senses Alice's intelligence and agrees to find a way to teach her.&nbsp; Gallaudet's interest in young Alice carries him across the ocean and back and eventually inspires him to create the nation's first school for the deaf, thus improving young Alice's life and the lives of generations of young, deaf students to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;This picture book presents what is essentially the "creation story" of Deaf Culture in America. Though the author is not a member of that culture herself, she chose her source material well by drawing on Harlan Lane's much-respected <i>When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf</i> (Random, 1984) and presenting its most compelling moments, including Lane's imagined dialogue during the meeting between Alice Cogswell and Laurent Clerc, the first deaf teacher in the U.S. McCully wisely keeps the focus on young Alice, the girl who lost her hearing during a bout of spotted fever, and, by virtue of being the daughter of a wealthy doctor and philanthropist who lived next door to minister Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, inspired the advent of deaf education in the United States. At her father's request, Gallaudet traveled first to England and then France to research methods of teaching deaf children, and in Paris met Laurent Clerc, with whom he would found the first permanent school for the deaf in the United States in 1817. And it is at that school that Clerc's French Sign Language mingled with the students' home signs to become American Sign Language. McCully's watercolor-and-ink illustrations capture the ever-proper feel of early-1800s Connecticut. An informative author's note gives more historical details and context, particularly to explain the stilted English of Alice's letters, written before she began her education under Clerc. This is a book that has been sorely needed for some time, and McCully pulls it off with panache.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The&nbsp;familiar breakthroughs of Helen Keller&nbsp;will lead&nbsp;many children&nbsp;to McCully&#x2019;s latest historical picture book, which&nbsp;introduces an earlier, and&nbsp;lesser-known,&nbsp;milestone in&nbsp;deaf education. Isolated, brooding Alice Cogswell, a deaf-mute child,&nbsp;stirs the compassion&nbsp;of neighbor Thomas Gallaudet, who &#x201c;pulls her from a&nbsp;kind of tomb&#x201d; by&nbsp;teaching her to read and write, then&nbsp;seeks greater knowledge&nbsp;abroad before returning to establish the school that would become the American School for the Deaf. The narrative&nbsp;addresses quite a few topics in a short space,&nbsp;and some&nbsp;confusion may result&nbsp;(at book&#x2019;s end, for instance, Alice welcomes&nbsp;a visiting specialist by signing &#x201c;My heart glow,&#x201d; even though the next page notes that ASL hadn&#x2019;t yet been developed). It&#x2019;s also a shame that no specific source notes are provided alongside the historical note and bibliography.&nbsp;The strengths of the book are the quotations from the letters exchanged between teacher and pupil during their long separation, which affectingly illustrate Cogswell&#x2019;s attachment to Gallaudet, and McCully&#x2019;s&nbsp;delicate ink-and-watercolor illustrations&nbsp;of her subjects&#x2019; privileged, early-nineteenth-century surroundings.

He lives in Weidman, Michigan with his wife, two horses, two dogs, five cats, five peacocks, two doves, about 25 chickens, and who knows how many fish.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>David Fisher </b>is the author or co-author of 18 <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, among them collaborations with New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin, entertainers George Burns, Leslie Nielsen, and Wil�liam Shatner; and Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning biochemist Kary Mullis. He lives in New York.<b>Open Your Mouth and Say Moo</b><p><b>WHY I BECAME A VET</b></p><p>When I was in veterinary school in the Netherlands in the 1960s, a farmer brought a cow to our clinic. &#x201c;My cow is not eating,&#x201d; he told us, &#x201c;and she is not making manure.&#x201d; We were all very confident students. We could diagnose everything and fix anything. So we examined this cow and discovered she had a fever, her stomach was not working, and she clearly was in some pain. All of those symptoms pointed toward hardware, meaning that the cow had swallowed a piece of metal, and then when her stomach contracted, that metal went through the wall of the stomach, causing the pain. This is very common; cows are indiscriminate eaters. A cow will eat anything you put in front of her, and too often there are little pieces of metal lying around the farmyard.</p><p>We had a brand-new X-ray machine at the college. Our professors were proud of this because it allowed us to see what was going on inside the animal. This X-ray capability was going to change veterinary medicine; it was going to make us all smarter and better animal doctors. After we diagnosed this cow with hardware, we sent her to the new X-ray department. The X-ray came back negative. &#x201c;No metal in this cow,&#x201d; we were told. &#x201c;Look again,&#x201d; our professors told us. &#x201c;She does not have hardware.&#x201d;</p><p>So then we examined this cow again. Same thing: elevated temperature, stomach&#x2019;s not working, pain. Diagnosis: hardware. We sent her back to the X-ray department and got the same result: &#x201c;There is no metal in this cow.&#x201d; So the professors put her in the stable to see what would happen. And what happened was that she died. So then they sent this cow to pathology: There was the stomach, the heart, the lungs, on a table. And they said to us, &#x201c;Take a look at this.&#x201d; And that cow had hardware.</p><p>Except that it wasn&#x2019;t metal, which was why that expensive X-ray machine didn&#x2019;t pick it up. It was a broom bristle six inches long. That cow had swallowed it and it had punctured the stomach wall and was going into the heart, and it had killed the cow. If we had listened to what that cow was telling us&#x2014;Hey, I got some hardware inside my stomach&#x2014;we would have done surgery, opened up the stomach, taken out the broom bristle, closed up the stomach, and given her some antibiotics, and she would have been fine.</p><p>So I learned how to be a hands-on veterinarian, an old-style vet. I use all the wonderful machines we have and I pay attention to what the animal&#x2019;s owner tells me, but mostly I look at the animal; I put my hands on the animal and I listen to what that animal is telling me. I have been practicing animal medicine for nearly a half century; I&#x2019;ve treated just about every type of creature you can imagine, from a white mouse to a twenty-six-hundred-pound horse, and I&#x2019;ve discovered that the longer I have been in practice, the smarter the animals have gotten!</p><p>I have spent my whole life being with animals, as a vet and as an owner. Until they start inventing new animals, I think I can say there isn&#x2019;t a type of animal I haven&#x2019;t looked in the eyes and wondered how it was feeling. My wife, Diane, and I once estimated that I&#x2019;ve handled more than a half-million patients, without one of them ever complaining about me! In 2009 my son, Charles, who had moved to Hollywood to be in the entertainment industry, thought that people might be interested in a television reality show about a farm vet. I asked him who he thought would be interested in watching an old man who speaks with a funny accent putting his hand up the back end of a cow.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I would,&#x201d; I agreed.</p><p>&#x201c;Everybody likes animals,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Every day in the practice is very different,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re dealing with life and death all the time and doing it with patients who can&#x2019;t tell you where it hurts. And unlike most city vets, you also have to consider the economic impact on the farmer&#x2019;s business. Besides,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re a character.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know if your son calling you a character was a compliment. But when he also pointed out that we would be telling the story of American farmers in the Midwest, that got me intrigued. I come from a farming family, I know how difficult that life can be, and I know that is a story very much worth telling. So I agreed to let his camera crew follow our staff for a few days, still wondering if anyone was going to watch.</p><p>It turned out Diane and I raised a smart son.</p><p>When I opened my practice outside the small town of Weidman, Michigan&#x2014;which is about twelve miles from the larger and better known Mount Pleasant&#x2014;in 1981, it was about 80 percent large animals, farm animals, and about 20 percent pets. It was mostly family dairy farms when we started, with several pig farmers. We took care of all their animals. But those family farms are mostly gone now; instead, we have the big concerns that supply to the chain stores, and they have their own vets. The workhorses are mostly gone too, and there are no more pig farmers. I remember that not too long after Diane and I moved to Mount Pleasant, I got a call from a farmer named Don Hatfield. Don and his brother had just taken over their uncle&#x2019;s dairy farm in Mecosta County, and they needed help with a calving. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re having trouble getting the calf out of the cow,&#x201d; he said in his wonderfully deep voice I got to know so well. When we started talking, Don admitted he didn&#x2019;t know much about dairying because his uncle, who had recently died, had taken care of the cows. So I spent quite a bit of time with at the farm, helping them out, teaching them how to care for their livestock. Don&#x2019;s family had been on the land a long time; that barn was just about one hundred years old. He was a wonderful man whose real passion was the history of this part of central Michigan. He interviewed all the old-timers and then compiled thick books telling the story of this area. Don did okay on the farm for a long time; then he more or less retired and sold the cows. When Don quit the barn I went over there and picked up some things I found lying around that I still have, like porcelain mineral cups for the cows. &#x201c;Take whatever you want,&#x201d; Don told me. I still hear that beautiful grumble of his voice in my head.</p><p>The next thing I knew, the farm was sold to a potato farmer, who dug a big hole and pushed the beautiful old stone house and the barn into it and covered them up. I drove by the place once and stopped to take a good look, and I couldn&#x2019;t even tell where the house and barn had been. All that was left standing was the electrical pole with a transformer. I just sat there for a little while staring sadly at that field and remembering the people who had once been there. A hundred years of farming history pushed into a hole.</p><p>Now my practice is about 60 percent small animals. There are basically three classes of animals: farm animals, work animals, and pets. There is obviously a big difference between them; the relationship between the farmer and his animals is based on economics. These animals are the farmer&#x2019;s livelihood. The relationship between pet owners and their animals is based on love. That difference doesn&#x2019;t matter at all to me; I treat all animals with the same concern.</p><p>I love animals; believe me, I don&#x2019;t remember a day of my life that I haven&#x2019;t loved animals. My whole family has always been comfortable with all kinds of animals. My mother used to tell us a story about her grandfather, who was said to be able to hypnotize animals. In his town in the Netherlands there was a butcher who had a big, mean German shepherd&#x2013;Saint Bernard cross. My great-grandfather and the butcher met on the road, and the butcher warned him, &#x201c;Watch out. He&#x2019;s a mean dog.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; my great-grandfather said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah? Well, this dog will take you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then go ahead and turn him loose,&#x201d; my great-grandfather challenged him. The butcher released the dog from his leash. My great-grandfather and that dog looked at each other. Neither one of them moved. Then the dog sat down. My great-grandfather took a step forward; the dog moved backward. And that dog was never very much of a guard dog after that.</p><p>Many people who have watched our show on the Nat Geo Wild channel know that I grew up on my father&#x2019;s forty-acre dairy farm in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II. We lived way out in the country, in an area that was called Wateren, and we had no electricity or running water. Wateren wasn&#x2019;t even a town; it was just a road with some houses on it. It was so far from everybody else that the daily newspaper came to our house a day late; it had to be delivered by the mail carrier. My dad hated that because he wanted to be on top of the news, but there was nothing we could do about it. We didn&#x2019;t even have a radio until 1950.</p><p>We lived in a big house, big enough for our whole family and all our livestock to be under one roof&#x2014;all the livestock except the pigs. Many farmhouses in that region were built that way. There was a hallway that led directly from our living area into the cow stable, so if you had to check on a cow at night you didn&#x2019;t have to get dressed; you just put on your slippers and walked into the barn. We didn&#x2019;t have indoor plumbing, so we used to take our baths in one of the big wooden tubs in the stable behind the cows because that was always the warmest place in the house. The cows kept it warm!</p><p>Behind the cow barn was the big area where we stored the hay and wheat as well as the farm machinery in the winter, and a stable for our three horses. All of this was under one big roof. Outside was the little shed for the pigs. We couldn&#x2019;t keep them inside because they smelled too bad. When you grow up living with animals, you learn how to respect them.</p><p>During the war people would ride their bicycles out to our farm to get away from the city or simply to get something to eat or milk to drink. The winter of 1944 was known as the Hunger Winter because the Germans cut off most of the food supplies to punish people for supporting the Resistance. My parents never turned away one person.</p><p>I was the youngest of six children, and we all were expected to do chores every day. We had all the farm animals&#x2014;we had about twenty cows, which we milked by hand; we had horses and chickens, turkeys, geese&#x2014;but my protector was a Saint Bernard that would not let anybody he didn&#x2019;t know come too close to me. We always had big dogs, still do. I learned from my father that if a farmer doesn&#x2019;t have respect for an animal, that animal will not work for him. He used to tell us, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t treat an animal right, that animal won&#x2019;t treat you right either.&#x201d;</p><p>My love of the animals almost got my family in terrible trouble one day. During the war we were not allowed to own anything; everything belonged to the occupier. All the production was for the benefit of the occupier. These weren&#x2019;t TV Nazis; they were the real thing. These people were very dangerous. They would come and inspect your farm, and if you got caught hiding anything, the best thing that would happen is they would take you to prison for a few years. Well, before I could talk, I called all cows &#x201c;boo.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t know where that came from, but to me all cows were &#x201c;boo.&#x201d; Even with all the danger, my father would sometimes hide a calf or some of the food we grew so we would have at least a little milk and food for ourselves. One day the inspector came to see all our cows. I was just a toddler holding on to my mother&#x2019;s hand. As we walked around, I pointed to each of the cows and said, &#x201c;Boo.&#x201d; But then I pointed to a closed door, the door that led to the place we were hiding that calf, and said, &#x201c;Boo.&#x201d; My older sister tells me that everybody got very scared for a few seconds; nobody took a breath. &#x201c;Boo,&#x201d; I said again, still pointing at the door. If that inspector opened the door, it was going to be a very bad time for us, but the inspector ignored me and kept walking. From then on I wasn&#x2019;t allowed anywhere near that German inspector when he came to our farm.</p><p>In those times it wasn&#x2019;t just livestock that we hid. For a time we sheltered a young Jewish boy who was somewhere between my age and my next oldest brother, who was seven years older than me. There was also a Jewish family hiding in a little shed, which wasn&#x2019;t much more than a deer-blind, in our woods. All the local people brought them food and the Nazis never found out about them.</p><p>My sister Henny tells me that my first pet was a crippled chicken. It was a chicken that had been stepped on and probably had a broken leg, so it limped or hopped. In Dutch, that&#x2019;s a kreupel kipi, crippled chicken, but the best I could pronounce it was urpa bipi. My sister says that my chicken stood by the door waiting for me to come outside. And I sat there with my chicken for hours, just petting it. So even then, I guess, I wanted to look after the hurt ones.</p><p>In the Netherlands at that time farmers didn&#x2019;t rely too much on the veterinarian. There were not many vets in the Netherlands then because, in fact, there wasn&#x2019;t that much they could do that farmers couldn&#x2019;t do by themselves. Farmers had to be self-reliant; if they weren&#x2019;t, they wouldn&#x2019;t be farming very long. If you had a cow, then you got a calf. If you had a horse, you got a foal. If you have a sheep, it gives lambs. If there was a problem, you&#x2019;d better be able to fix it yourself. Only when you couldn&#x2019;t fix it, or your neighbor couldn&#x2019;t fix it, would you call the vet.</p><p>The nearest vet to us was Dr. Van der Eyck, who lived more than eight kilometers away. We didn&#x2019;t have a telephone, so if there was a problem, one of us had to get on our bike and ride as fast as we could to his house; when we got there we rang the doorbell and hoped he was home. There were times he was at the farm before we even got back.</p><p>The most famous vet in the Netherlands was a fictional character named Dr. Jan Vlimmen. There were several novels written about him, and there was even a movie made. But one story sums up very well the way the Dutch people thought about vets. Late one night Dr. Vlimmen&#x2019;s bell rang. When he answered, a man was standing there. &#x201c;How much would it cost to make a farm call at this hour?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>After finding out how far away this farm was, Dr. Vlimmen told him, &#x201c;That will be ten guilders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I will ride along with you to show you the way.&#x201d;</p><p>So off they went. When they reached the farm, Dr. Vlimmen looked around but did not see any animals in distress. &#x201c;So where is this sick cow?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; the man admitted, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really have a sick cow. It&#x2019;s just that you were cheaper than a taxi!&#x201d;</p><p>I decided I wanted to be a vet when I was twelve years old. I can still remember the day. It wasn&#x2019;t because I thought I could make a successful career out of being a vet; believe me, I never even thought about the business part of it. In fact, on our very first day in school they warned us that there were very few opportunities for vets in the Netherlands and that most of us would never practice. I didn&#x2019;t worry about that; I became a vet because it was the only thing I ever wanted to do.</p><p>My life changed forever the day Dr. Van der Eyck drove into our yard. &#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; he said. I was tall and very thin, but that morning the most important thing was that I had very long arms.</p><p>As long as I can remember, I have...</p></p><h2>Heart of Courage (Heart Trilogy, Book 3)</h2><p><br><br>Under the pert pen name "Lady Smart," opinionated Lindsey Graham crusades for social change among London's elite, writing for the ladies' gazette <i>Heart to Heart</i>.

He figured the best use for a newspaper was to wrap up dead fish. He admitted it was probably important to keep up with what was happening around him, so he struggled through the English words, a language he had only started learning a little over two years ago. Before that, he had lived on an island far to the north, an isolated world only a handful of people knew existed.<br><br>With the help of his teacher, Professor Paxton Hart, he had learned to read and write, how to dress and move about in English society. Leif and his wife helped as well, and life here grew easier all the time. Still, Thor liked being out of doors, not inside reading a book.<br><br>"So you're the one who stole my paper!" An indignant female voice snagged his attention. "I've been looking all over." Hands on hips, Lindsey Graham marched across the office like a raven swooping down on its prey.<br><br>Holding the evidence of his guilt in one big hand, Thor stood in the doorway of the back room of <i>Heart to Heart, </i>the ladies' magazine owned by his brother's wife, Krista Hart Draugr, and her father, his teacher, Sir Paxton Hart. It was Thursday, the day before the paper came out, and the office hummed with activity.<br><br>"I did not steal it," he said to the avenging angel bearing down on him. "I borrowed it. I wanted to know about the murder."<br><br>Her eyes shot to his, a tawny golden color like the she-cat she was. "There was a second murder?"<br><br>He nodded, held the paper so she could read the headline. "Down in Covent Garden," he said. "Same as before."<br><br>Lindsey took the newspaper and scanned the article. She was taller than the average woman, yet far shorter than his six-foot-five-inch frame. She was slender, her hair a light golden brown. With her fine-boned, delicate features, she was pretty, but not in the way he preferred.<br><br>Like his brother, he wanted his women lusty, buxom and full-breasted, the kind built to satisfy a man. Leif had found Krista, the mate of his heart. Thor was still looking for the female who would be his.<br><br>"Another woman killed," Lindsey said, her tawny gaze glued to the page, "strangled just like the last time. The police believe the same man is likely responsible."<br><br>Lindsey was editor of the women's section of the paper and also wrote a gossip column called <i>Heartbeat. </i>She was a hard worker, he knew, a quality he admired since he worked so hard himself. Whenever he wasn't down at the docks, bossing the stevedores who loaded and unloaded the cargo carried by his brother's company, Valhalla Shipping, he worked for <i>Heart to Heart. </i>He was saving his money to buy a place in the country, far away from the choking air of London.<br><br>"Here's something new," Lindsey went on, her fine, straight nose immersed in the printed lines. "It says the women who were killed were 'ladies of the evening.'"<br><br>"Whores," Thor said simply.<br><br>Lindsey blushed. "That does not mean it is all right for someone to kill them."<br><br>"I did not say that."<br><br>She sighed. "I feel sorry for the people who live in the neighborhood. Two murders in the last six months. They must be terrified. I certainly hope the police apprehend him this time."<br><br>"The paper says they have found clues. They believe they will soon have a suspect. Mayhap this time they will catch him."<br><br>"I wonder what they have discovered."<br><br>Thor made no reply, since neither of them knew the answer. Engrossed in the paper, Lindsey wandered over to her desk, sat down and continued to read. In the middle of the room, the big Stanhope press sat silent, but soon the next edition would be rumbling off for sale on the streets.<br><br>Thor liked to watch the press at work. In truth, he was amazed by the heavy machinery he had seen since his arrival in England, equipment that could spin cotton into cloth, or press glass into various shapes and sizes. There were even powerful steam machines called locomotives that could carry people to distant places in hours instead of days.<br><br>There was nothing like that on the remote island of Draugr where he and Leif had been born and raised. People on Draugr still lived as they had hundreds of years ago. They were warriors and farmers, not city dwellers like the people in London.<br><br>Flashing a smile at the typesetter, Bessie Briggs, an older woman who mothered him as if he were her son, he went back to work stacking boxes and crates, making room for tomorrow's papers.<br><br>It was only a few minutes later that the bell rang above the front door, drawing his attention to a thin man, slightly beak-nosed and dark-haired, who walked into the office. Dressed in an expensive-looking dark brown tailcoat and tan trousers, he carried one of those stupid high hats London men favored and Thor flatly refused to wear.<br><br>Returning to his work, he forgot about the man until he heard voices raised in anger. Saying a grateful prayer that this time the object of Lindsey's wrath was someone else, he gazed through the door in her direction and saw the well-dressed man standing next to her desk. They were arguing. Noticing the hard set of the man's jaw, the blood-lust in his eyes, Thor's senses went on alert.<br><br>Lindsey clamped her hands on her hips. "I don't give a fig whether you bloody well like it or not. If you hadn't been cheating on your wife, I wouldn't have found out and I wouldn't have written about you in my column!"<br><br>"You little bitch! My wife is threatening divorce. I am the Earl of Fulcroft and a Whitfield, and Whitfields do not divorce! You will write a retraction immediately or I will personally see you ruined!"<br><br>"And how, may I ask, do you intend to do that?"<br><br>A grim smile curved the earl's lips. "I will dig into your past until I find something that will scandalize the very people your column is meant to impress. There will be something&#x2014;there always is&#x2014;no matter how young and innocent you seem. And I shall keep digging until I find it! Then we'll see how much <i>you </i>'bloody well like it!'"<br><br>Thor had heard enough. Seeing Lindsey's face had turned a little pale, he strode toward Fulcroft, grabbed him by the lapels of his expensive coat and jerked him up on his toes.<br><br>"You are finished with your threats to the lady. You will apologize for the name you called her and then you will leave."<br><br>"Put me down this instant!"<br><br>Ignoring the stunned look on Lindsey's face, Thor shook him like the rat he was. "I said you will apologize. Do it now."<br><br>The earl dangled there, his feet swinging, his shiny leather shoes dangling several inches above the floor. "All right, all right. I'm sorry I called you a bitch. Now put me down!"<br><br>Thor set the man back on his feet and the earl eased toward the door. He pierced Lindsey with a glare. "Your bulldog notwithstanding, I meant every word. I'll expect to read your retraction in the next edition of the paper."<br><br>"Don't hold your breath!" Lindsey called after him as he turned and hurried out of the office.<br><br>Thor was feeling well pleased with himself when Lindsey rounded on him. "Don't you ever do that again!"<br><br>"What are you talking about?"<br><br>"You interfered in my business. I can deal with my problems myself. I don't need any help from you."<br><br>Thor clenched his jaw. "You wished for the man to continue his insults? You did not mind that he called you a female dog?"<br><br>Her eyes widened. Then a corner of her mouth twitched. "I minded. But I could have handled him myself."<br><br>"Fine. The next time a man insults you, I will pretend not to hear. Does that suit you, lady?"<br><br>Her eyes held his an instant before she glanced away. "It suits me. I don't need your help or anyone else's."<br><br>Thor shook his head. "Stubborn as an ugly horse."<br><br>"You mean mule," she corrected.<br><br>"Fine. Stubborn as a mule."<br><br>Lindsey flashed him a last brief glance, turned and walked away.<br><br><i>Damned woman, </i>he thought, trying not to notice the way her hips swayed beneath her full skirts, to wonder if her waist was really small enough for his hands to fit around it. She was as slender as a boy. Why he should notice her at all he could not imagine.<br><br>Still, he had to admit she had a very pretty face and skin as smooth and pale as cream. Her hair, the color of rich, dark honey, shimmered in the sun shining in through the window.<br><br>His body tightened. Grinding his jaw against a shot of lust that angered him more than aroused him, he strode back to the rear of the office and began stacking the rest of the newspaper bundles.<br><br>He wasn't attracted to Lindsey Graham. She wasn't the sort of woman he found the least attractive. But as she moved across the office in that graceful way of hers, Thor found himself watching her again.<br><br>Lindsey finished reworking the notes she had made for this week's column. At the back of the office, she could hear Thor at work loading stacks of bound newspapers, getting ready for the edition that would be on the streets tomorrow.<br><br>Lindsey knew Krista was eager for this particular issue to come out. She was campaigning hard against the institution of baby farming, the awful practice of selling illegitimate infants into places that ultimately resulted in their deaths, neatly disposing of unwanted problems.<br><br>Their mutual friend, Coralee Whitmore Forsythe, had uncovered the terrible practice during her search for the man who had murdered her sister. While Corrie was away on her quest, Lindsey had taken over writing the society column for the gazette. Though Corrie was currently on her honeymoon with her husband, the Earl of Tremaine, once she returned to England, she and Gray would add their support to Krista's campaign.<br><br>Lindsey glanced through the door leading into the back room of the office. She could see Thor at work, his powerful body hoisting and moving the bound stacks of newspapers as if they weighed nothing. It was a laborer's job. Thor was a man who seemed to enjoy physical exertion.<br><br>He wasn't obsessed with learning as his older brother, Leif, had been, but considering he had arrived in England only a few years ago, he had educated himself fairly well.<br><br>She didn't know much about him, only that he came from some tiny island north of the Orkneys. He spoke English well, with just a slight accent that sounded faintly Norwegian. He could read and write, though not as well as he could speak, and Krista and her father had taught him at least the basics necessary to move about in polite society.<br><br>Still, in most ways, the man was a barbarian. He had no interest in the arts, theater, or opera, no desire to attend the soirees, balls, and risottos that Lindsey enjoyed so much. As society editor of <i>Heart to Heart </i>and author of the weekly gossip column, <i>Heartbeat, </i>it was necessary for her to mingle and mix with the social elite. As the daughter of a baron, Lindsey did it well.<br><br>She liked her job, liked the independence it gave her. Of course, in the beginning, her mother and father had been horrified at the notion of their twenty-two-year-old daughter actually <i>working, </i>but they were gone a great deal and Lindsey had insisted she needed something to do. In the end, as usual, she had gotten her way.<br><br>Once again, her parents were traveling on the Continent, leaving Lindsey in the house under the care of her mother's older sister, Delilah Markham, Countess of Ashford. Lindsey liked her aunt, an extremely forward-thinking woman who, at forty-six, had lived an exciting life and intended to enjoy every moment of the years ahead.<br><br>Which meant that basically, Lindsey was on her own.<br><br>It was warm in the office this early September day. Lindsey fanned herself with the newspaper she had been reading, then flicked a glance toward the back of the building, where Thor bent down to hoist another bundle. He always dressed simply, never wore a waistcoat, cravat or stock.<br><br>Her eyes widened as she realized the man had stripped off his tailcoat and unbuttoned his fine lawn shirt all the way to his navel. She could see his massive chest, a wide V of swarthy skin covered by thick slabs of muscle, even the ladder of muscle across his flat belly. The work was heavy and perspiration ran in rivulets through his dark hair and down his thick neck. It plastered his shirt to his incredible body. His arms bulged with muscle, and when he turned away, slabs of muscle tightened across his broad back.<br><br>Lindsey's stomach contracted. The only thing the big brute had going for him was a body that seemed to mimic the Norse god he was named for, and eyes so blue that when you looked into them, you felt as if you might disappear.<br><br>It simply wasn't fair that a man should look so good on the outside and have so little of interest on the inside.<br><br>It simply wasn't fair.<br><br>Still, Lindsey stared at him, unable to look away, fascinated until he turned round and caught her.<br><br>His dark head came up and those incredible blue eyes locked on her face.<br><br>"I am not decently clothed," he said. "A lady would not look."<br><br>Her chin inched up. "And a gentleman would not disrobe except in private!" Whirling her chair around, her pulse hammering far too fast, she jerked her plumed pen from its silver holder, jabbed it into the inkwell and stabbed it down on the paper, leaving a purple stain as she tried to scratch out the first paragraph of her upcoming column.<br><br>Thor said something beneath his breath and went back to hoisting bundles.<br><br>"Are you all right?"<br><br>Her head came up and she flushed guiltily at the sight of her employer and best friend, Krista Hart Draugr, approaching her desk. She started to say that she was just fine before Thor had stripped off half his clothes, but stopped when she realized Krista was referring to the argument she'd had earlier with the Earl of Fulcroft, not Thor.<br><br>"Bessie told me about the earl," Krista went on. "I'm sorry I wasn't here." She was tall, taller than most men, except, of course, for her husband and Thor. With her big green eyes and golden blond hair, she was a beautiful woman. And she had found exactly the right man for her in Leif. The pair had a nine-month-old son they adored, and as virile as both brothers appeared to be, soon there would probably be another addition to the family.<br><br>Lindsey looked up at Krista and smiled. "I am fine. Fulcroft was just blowing off steam."<br><br></p><h2>Grammaire du Francais (Livre de poche) (French Edition)</h2><p>A clear and detailed grammar of the French language written in French.</p><p></p><h2>Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine: Stories</h2><p>Twelve stories that teeter between wicked humor and stinging pathos encompassdilapidated right arenas, state mental hospitals, and chaotic emergency roomswhere the inhabitants are brilliantly etched characters.</p><p>Welcome back to the world of boot camp, boxing gyms, psych wards, and pharmaceutical highs. Once again, Thom Jones seems less to write fiction than to allow his characters to pour their stories directly into the reader's ear. Here the cast includes some of the usual suspects--jittery fighters, Marines, Vietnam vets--as well as some new but equally quirky voices, from a nebbishy vice principal to a 92-year-old woman. First seen in Jones's debut collection, <i>The Pugilist at Rest</i>, the crack Marine recon team Break On Thru makes several more sorties--most notably in "Fields of Purple Forever," in which the civilian Sergeant Ondine takes up swimming much the same way Odysseus, say, took up sailing: "Ondine a night swimmer and he <i>all over</i> the night. Captain of the night. I swim in the fields of purple. Nothing and no one can harm me forever." "Tarantula" chronicles the rise and fall of John Harold Hammermeister, vice principal of W.E.B. Du Bois High School, where the students fail to be impressed by his caged spider and the frustrated janitors prove his undoing. "My Heroic Mythic Journey" follows the downward career arc of its boxer protagonist, who becomes featherweight champion of the world only to fall for a "bleach-bottle blond with a cheating heart" and a loaded .38. Most winning of all is the elderly narrator of "Daddy's Girl," who manages to preserve her faith even with two dead husbands, countless family tragedies, and eyelids growing up into her eyes: "You have to believe like a little child. Believe it because it's impossible." Only the overlong concluding story, "You Cheated, You Lied," disappoints; as chaotic as the main characters' mood swings, it follows two crazy teenagers in love and off their medication. But this tale is an exception in an otherwise noteworthy collection. <i>Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine</i> only confirms Jones's place as one of the most original American writers at work today. <i>--Mary Park</i>&#34;Thom Jones is the author of two previous short story collections, Cold Snap and The Pugilist at Rest, a National Book Award finalist.

Tour.</p><p>In examining the still-unsolved 1975 murder of 15-year-old Martha Moxley in a wealthy suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut, first-time author Timothy Dumas does not attempt to deliver a knockout punch of new evidence that might crack the case wide open. Instead, Dumas takes his readers on a literate excursion through the darkest secrets and fears of the girl's neighbors and fellow townspeople as they attempt to cope--first with the murder itself, and then with the helplessness of almost a quarter century of frustration as the case remains unsolved. <p> It's not that most people in town don't have any clue who performed the crime, Dumas shows, but that a moat of distance lies between the killer and those who would punish such a crime, a distance mainly built on the power, money, and political connections of the wealthy Skakel family, related by marriage to the Kennedys. </p><p> Dumas weaves a spellbinding tale, cut in the mold of Truman Capote's <i>In Cold Blood</i> or, more recently, John Berendt's <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>. Fans of those works will almost certainly enjoy this evocative and finely constructed story as well. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>Timothy Dumas was for many years the managing editor of Greenwich News.</p><h2>The Best of Subterranean</h2><p>From its launch in 2005 to its final issue in 2014, <i>Subterranean</i> magazine published stories by the leading lights of science fiction and fantasy literature.

Of course, it's easier to believe when that pet happens to be an imposing white bull terrier with a sympathetic underbite and bi-colored, beseechingly human eyes. Whatley's realistic colored-pencil drawings of Skitty's antics will have youngsters giggling even if they don't own a pooch. The expressive illustrations, all of which provide a dog's-eye view, are delightfully absurd (and just barely exaggerated). It's hard not to smile at the ceaseless cajoling of this food vacuum cleaner. The "Mum" and "biscuit with tea" and, possibly, the baby's attire are the only giveaways that this is an Australian publication.

Relying on a foundation of excellent research, and exercising great narrative skill, the author details Parisian political and social life before and after the war. A city attractive to tourists because of its visionary civic planning, rich culture and sensuality was brought to its knees by a Prussian siege that resulted in widespread starvation and death. Angered by financial hardships imposed by a monarchist assembly, elected after peace was restored, working-class Parisians formed a government in 1871; their "Paris Commune" rebelled against the ruling powers. Life during the following two-month civil war, which ended with the defeat of the commune and the execution of its leaders, is vividly described in this gripping social history. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Despite the title of this superb book, it is actually a chronicle of far more than the Paris Commune. Rather, Christiansen offers a cogent, beautifully written examination of the society that made the conflagration of the Commune almost inevitable. The Second Empire of Louis Napoleon was a study in irreconcilable contrasts: the glittering Paris boulevards hid some of the most wretched slums of Europe. Behind a veneer of bourgeois respectability, prostitutes and innumerable petty corruptions permeated all levels of society. At the apex of this collapsing Potemkin pyramid was Louis Napoleon--vain, impetuous, and conservative politically, but imbued with an absurd sense of destiny, which led him to schemes worthy of a utopian socialist. When Christiansen recounts the story of the Commune itself, he does so with a sense of detached horror as the grisly tragedy unfolds. For the author, it is a nightmarish but fitting climax to the grand guignol absurdity that this Babylon had become. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p><h2>The Little Nugget (Everyman Wodehouse)</h2><p>Lang:- eng, Pages 236.

The Best American Sports Writing of the Century showcases the best sports journalists of the twentieth century, from Jimmy Cannon, Red Smith, William Mack, Gary Smith, and Frank Deford to A. J. Liebling, Tom Wolfe, and Hunter S. Thompson, and includes such classics as &#34;What Do You Think of Ted Williams Now?&#34; by Richard Ben Cramer, &#34;Louis Knocks Out Schmeling&#34; by Bob Considine, and &#34;The Rocky Road of Pistol Pete&#34; by W. C. Heinz. This outstanding collection captures not only the century&#39;s greatest moments in baseball, boxing, horseracing, golf, and tennis, but some of the finest writing of our time. Guest editor David Halberstam is the author of The Reckoning, The Summer of Forty-Nine, The Breaks of the Game, and, most recently, The Children. Series editor Glenn Stout has written biographies of Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and Jackie Robinson.</p><p>Given the overall vigor and volume of sports writing in America throughout the 20th century, the idea of compiling a single collection dubbed the "best" requires a daring balancing act of boldness and delicacy. And that's just what it is. Sports fans--but why limit this sparkling, spirited, passionate prose to just sports fans?--will revel in the equilibrium of David Halberstam's and Glenn Stout's wide range of selections. Their tribute to the knights of the keyboards is Hall of Fame-level from cover to cover. <p> Halberstam and Stout don't waste any time. They lead off with one of the great tours de force of American nonfiction, Gay Talese's stunningly poignant, 1966 profile of a moody Joe DiMaggio, "The Silent Season of a Hero." Then, before you can finish digesting it, they loudly switch gears to Tom Wolfe's "The Last American Hero," a razzle-dazzle look at Junior Johnson and the world of stock-car racing. By the time <i>Best</i> takes the checkered flag nearly 800 pages later, it has covered a remarkably rich and varied course that runs through the pens of such remarkable talents as Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Frank Deford, W.C. Heinz, Jim Murray, Murray Kempton, Ring Lardner, John Lardner, Jimmy Breslin, Al Stump, John Updike, John McPhee, Hunter Thompson, Norman Mailer, Jon Krakauer, Tom Boswell, Roger Angell, and David Remnick. Whew! </p><p> Like the best sportswriting, of course, <i>Best</i> is much more than fun and games, though there's plenty of that in its pages. <i>Best</i> is history captured on the fly through the games we play and the memorable players--Jackie Robinson, Joe Louis, Mohammad Ali, Secretariat, Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Red Grange--who play them. From selection to selection, writes Halberstam in his introduction, "we watch the country change." Certainly, sports--and sportswriting--have provided America a marvelous box seat for the contemplation of its own metamorphoses. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i></p>David Halberstam is the author of &#34;&#39;The Reckoning,&#34;&#39; &#34;&#39;The Summer of Forty-nine,&#34;&#39; &#34;&#39;The children,&#34;&#39; and, most recently, &#34;&#39;Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made.&#34;&#39;</p><h2>Moonlight Becomes You</h2><p>During a visit to her former stepmother&#39;s home in Newport, Rhode Island, Maggie Holloway, a young photographer and amateur sculptor, seeks the truth about the mysterious murder of her stepmother, an investigation that leads to a nursing home plagued by a series of sudden deaths. 1,000,000 first printing.

These methods have already revolutionised the world of competition flyfishing. This book explains all aspects of this explosively popular new method of flyfishing and shows how the recreational fly fisherman can easily master these techniques. The use of ultra-long tapered leaders provides huge advantages both in terms of reducing drag and dramatically improving fly presentation. This is the first book to explain all branches of French leader technique: sight nymphing, short and long-range indicator nymphing, dry fly fishing, for trout, carp and steelhead. It includes tips for fishing in all types of river and clear stillwaters in the USA, UK, Continental Europe, and the Southern Hemisphere. Julien Daguillanes, who is pictured on the front cover and contributed a masterclass chapter to the book, won the 2016 Individual Gold Medal at the Flyfishing World Championships in Vail, Colorado, underlining how European nymphing is�&nbsp;just as effective in the USA as in Europe.<br><br>Major contributors to this book include: Cody Burgdorff (USA), Oscar Boatfield (UK), Julien Daguillanes (France), Stanislav Mankov (Bulgaria).

He started flyfishing on the river Teme in Shropshire as a ten-year-old and has now fished the Welsh border streams regularly for 45 years. Since retiring from a career in international banking, he fishes several times a year on the southern chalkstreams, particularly the Test, and also often visits Scotland to fish on the Tweed and the Spey.Cody Burgdorff on the Versatility of the French Leader<br><br>The great strength of the French leader is that it is so versatile. It can be used on large or small streams, tailwaters or freestones, and can also be used effectively for many different species. The fact that fish, in particular trout, eat nearly 90% of their meals underneath the surface of the water tells me that nymphing is usually the best option for catching fish.<br><br>The main advantages of the French leader compared to other techniques are stealth and contact. Long leaders mean that stealth is easily achieved, as the fisherman is able to fish for trout and other species at a distance, something that is not achievable with Czech nymphing. The ability to fish at distance makes the French leader very effective when sight fishing, either for trout or for very spooky carp, where stealth is absolutely the key to success.<br><br>The other advantage of the French leader is contact with the flies. By using a long leader and maintaining a tight line, there is contact throughout the drift of the nymphs. This makes detecting takes, and striking quickly, much easier.<br><br>While the technique can be used and adapted for most situations, I believe that it works best for rivers that are wider than 10m and have a depth of 0.75m to 2m. French leaders are particularly efficient for covering shallow riffles and runs, as well as pools and runs up to 2m deep.<br><br>This is not to say that French leaders mean focussing on small fish. Nothing could be further from the truth! Last summer I was on the Blue River in Colorado with my good friend Zach Lass. A rainstorm had dirtied up a section of the water that holds large fish. With the higher flows and dirty water, fishing artificial worms and mysid shrimp on this tailwater seemed like an obvious choice. After a few 3-4lb fish, I hooked into a fish that I knew was massive as soon as it rolled at the top. After a huge battle we landed the fish, a rainbow that measured 28" and was easily over 10lbs. Landing such a fish on a 10ft 2wt and 6x tippet was an unforgettable experience! <br><br>French leaders can be used for any stream-dwelling fish. Trout, grayling, whitefish, carp, and smallmouth bass are some of the many species I have caught with this technique. I have had great success with it on heavily-fished streams, as well as freestones that have very little pressure.</p><h2>Secrets of Gypsy Fortunetelling (Llewellyn&#39;s New Age Series)</h2><p><br>Have you ever wanted to learn how to tell fortunes?

Born in the United States, and raised in England, she studied English at Oxford and then received her master's degree from Harvard. She considered Heyer's work to be of high literary merit.</p><p>FOREWORD</p> <p>Georgette Heyer was an intensely private person. A best-seller all her life without the aid of publicity, she made no appearances, never gave an interview, and only answered fan letters herself if they made an interesting historical point. Having scored an instant success with The Black Moth at the age of nineteen under her own name, Georgette Heyer, she experimented with a pseudonym, Stella Martin, for her third book, published by Mills &amp; Boon, then achieved a permanent alias when she married Ronald Rougier at twenty-three. From then on, Georgette Heyer wrote the best-sellers, while Mrs Ronald Rougier led the deeply private life. She never talked about her background and early years, giving only the barest facts of her life in eighteen lines of Who's Who. After her death, A. S. Byatt, the critic and novelist, wrote an invaluable long memorial piece for the Sunday Times, based on interviews with her husband, her friend Carola Oman and her two good publisher friends, A. S. Frere of Heinemann and Max Reinhardt of The Bodley Head. This is the only source for much of the information about her early life, about which she herself never talked. I have been able to supplement it by talking to her surviving family and friends (her husband and Carola Oman are now both dead) and by reference to her letters and to the four early novels she later suppressed.</p> <p>Her own invariable answer, when asked about her private life, was to refer the questioner back to her books. You will find me, she said, in my work. So should one now, almost ten years after her death, try to look behind the curtain of privacy in which she shrouded herself? My first instinct, when I started work on this book, was to concentrate entirely on the work, merely giving the barest facts of her life as a foreword. Then I began to talk to the people who knew her, and to read her letters. Everyone who knew her had loved or respected her, and they all seemed glad that a book should be written about her. But her own letters settled the question. She may have been a private person socially, almost a recluse, but on paper she was a compulsive communicator. And she wrote, her son says, just as she talked. Her letters to her publishers are full of sidelights on her own life and pungent comments on the world at large. They confirm, in short, her friends' unanimous description of her as shy on the surface, but a formidable, positive person underneath, with strong views and a great sense of style.</p> <p>It hardly sounds the description of a purveyor of romantic froth. But in fact, for those with eyes to see, the strong character is there in her books, even in the lightest and most frivolous of them, and an awareness of the kind of person she was adds a new dimension to one's enjoyment of them, or, perhaps, helps to explain just why one does enjoy them. She may have been a compulsive writer, but she was also an immensely skilled and meticulous craftswoman. She did her best to conceal her high standards and stern moral code behind the mask of romantic comedy, and succeeded, so far as her great fan public was concerned. But she had a smaller audience, among dons and journalists, among her husband's legal associates, among intelligent women everywhere, and even among feminists, who enjoyed the romantic syllabub all the more because they were aware of the hard core of realism underneath.</p> <p>Naturally, it was the ravening fan public that made its voice most clearly heard during her lifetime, and its adulation served both to drive her further into herself and to put off readers who might have enjoyed her as they do Jane Austen or even Ivy Compton-Burnett, a favourite of hers. There is a terrible snobbery in the average intellectual reaction to her work. It is not everyone who has given her name to a type of novel, and it is unfortunate that that name should tend to provoke an uninformed, unjustified sneer. My aim in this book is to try to redress the balance by giving a feeling of her and of her work, as far as possible through her own words in the extensive correspondence which her publishers have kindly made available to me and her letters to friends. Some of her friends, though happy to talk about Georgette Heyer, have felt that she would not have wished her letters shown or quoted, and this is a feeling that must be respected. Her letters to her publishers, on the other hand, are part of the professional world she enjoyed, and unless otherwise indicated all the quotations in this book are from them. </p> <p>Unfortunately, hardly any letters survive from before the 1940s, when she herself was in her forties and had been a best-seller for years. By this time she was taking a sadly deprecatory line about her own work. Speaking of Friday's Child in 1943 she says: 'Spread the glad tidings that it will not disappoint Miss Heyer's many admirers. Judging from the letters I've received from obviously feeble-minded persons who do so wish I could write another These Old Shades, it ought to sell like hot cakes. I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense, but it's unquestionably good escapist literature, and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter, or recovering from flu. Its period detail is good; my husband says it's witty &#x2013; and without going to these lengths, I will say that it is very good fun.'</p> <p>The statement sums up the problem she had with her readers. The dons and lawyers mostly kept quiet. The more vociferous of the fans tended to like the wrong books for the wrong reasons. They kept asking for swashbuckling romance when she was writing neat romantic comedy in the vein of Congreve and Sheridan. The reviewers, too, failed to appreciate the style and craftsmanship of her work as it developed into what would be known as 'the Georgette Heyer.' It is no wonder that she turned against publicity of any kind. As well as the letters, Georgette Heyer left the unfinished typescript of about half of what she had planned as a serious mediaeval book, since published as My Lord John; a remarkable research library of some thousand volumes (now unfortunately dispersed); and a small but highly significant collection of papers, to which her son has kindly given me access. There was no attic full of carefully hoarded manuscripts and first drafts. A flat-dweller since 1939, she found the proliferating copies of her published books problem enough without indulging in the sentiment of keeping old papers, however fascinating they might have proved to posterity. She saved a few reviews, and one fan letter. It was from a woman who had kept herself and her cell-mates sane through twelve years in a Romanian political prison by telling the story of Friday's Child over and over again. </p></p><h2>Treason by the Book</h2><p>An acclaimed historian delves deeply into a famous 1728 plot to overthrow the Manchu dynasty, in a fascinating study of the intrigues, political and legal systems, and key personalities of eighteenth-century China. By the author of The Gate of Heavenly Peace. 22,500 first printing.</p><p>Jonathan Spence's eleven books on Chinese history include <i>The Gate of Heavenly Peace</i>, <i>Treason by the Book</i>, and <i>The Death of Woman Wang</i>. His awards include a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship. He teaches at Yale University.The General <p>General Yue Zhongqi has risen far and fast, which is what makes the present moment so dangerous for him. Born in 1686, the son of a general, Yue was a major at age twenty-five, a colonel at thirty-two, and was named commander-in-chief of Sichuan province at thirty-five. His string of military successes includes campaigns along the Tibetan border, in Kokonor, against mountain tribes in Xining, in China's westernmost province of Gansu, and on the borders of the far southern province of Yunnan. Now, in late October 1728, at the age of forty-two, not only is he governor-general of two provinces, and the regional commander-in-chief, but he has also been ennobled by a grateful emperor, and his own son in turn has been swiftly promoted to high office and is currently the acting governor of one of the strategic coastal provinces. The Yue family are rich; they hold huge estates in Gansu province in the far west, and in Sichuan to the south. The family inventories list dozens of properties held in the Yue name, great mansions with tiled roofs and multiple courtyards in several major cities, fine farmland scattered across several regions, and scores of caretakers and bailiffs who manage the estates when Yue Zhongqi is away on duty. </p><p>Yet despite his power and wealth, Yue Zhongqi knows he is totally at the emperor's mercy. Everything he has earned and won could vanish in an instant should the emperor doubt his loyalty. For the current emperors of China are the Manchus, warrior stock from the north, who conquered the armies of the floundering Ming dynasty in 1644 with their cavalry, established the Qing dynasty in its place, and have ruled the country ever since, constantly watchful to preserve their own prerogatives. </p><p>Another factor underlines the precariousness of General Yue's position: the burden of his family name. Yue Zhongqi is both blessed and cursed by being a distant descendant of another General Yue-Yue Fei-who six centuries earlier, in the time of the Song dynasty, tried to rally the Chinese of his own day to reclaim the lands they had lost in the north to barbarian conquerors. Yue Fei fought as long and as bravely as he could, until betrayed by his own countrymen and jealous courtiers. Imprisoned on a trumped-up charge, Yue Fei died in captivity, and the northern lands were lost. With time, Yue Fei's recklessness came to be seen as statesmanship, and his yearning plea to regain for China her "mountains and rivers" became a rallying cry for all Chinese people. Shrines to Yue Fei were erected in his native place. Plays and novels celebrated his passionate ambitions. Storytellers elaborated on his punctilious character and his prowess on the battlefield. They made their listeners weep as they recorded the warrior's courage amidst the carnage of war, and the perfidy of the political enemies who betrayed him. The Manchus who overthrew the Ming in 1644 were descendants of those same Jurchen tribesmen against whom Yue Fei fought for so long; thus, not surprisingly, Yue Fei's memory became once more a rallying cry for those who hated the Manchus. However loyal Yue Zhongqi may be to the current Manchu emperor, the popular belief is that he is primed for vengeance by virtue of his ancestral blood, and poised to restore China's former glories. General Yue knows this, and he knows that his emperor knows it. </p><p>Alone in his study, Yue Zhongqi moves to the heart of the letter that has just been handed to him. Some of it he has heard before and knows all too well, such as the passage hailing him as "the descendant of the Song dynasty martial prince Yue Fei," and urging him to "seize the chance to rise in revolt, and avenge the fates of the Song and Ming." "Once you have taken someone as your true ruler," the letter continues, "you should guard your relationship to that former person to the death. But instead you bow your head and compromise your loyalty by serving a bandit ruler." By serving the Manchus instead of keeping the faith with his illustrious ancestor, the current general Yue has compromised his very being: "A minister's choosing his ruler is like a woman following her husband. A man serving someone who is not truly his ruler, and thereby losing his moral character, is like a woman who has once been married and gets married for a second time." </p><p>But the letter by this man who calls himself Summer Calm also takes the familiar litany out into new terrain: "When the rulers of the Ming dynasty lost their virtuous ways, the land of China was submerged, the barbarians took advantage of our weakness to enter, and usurped our precious throne," he writes. "The barbarians are a different species from us, like animals; it is the Chinese who should stay in this land, and the barbarians who should be driven out." The reasons for this are obvious: "Heaven gives birth to humans and to things. The principle is one, though the manifestations are many. Those living on Chinese soil have the proper elements, their yin and their yang are in harmony, they possess virtue, they are human. Those outside the borders, in all four directions, they are oblique and vicious by nature, they are the barbarians. Below the barbarians come the animals." </p><p>Other passages in the letter speak of the portents darkening China's future as the country suffers under the barbarian Manchus' rule: "Heaven and earth are overturned, darkness prevails, there is no light." That is why, the letter continues, the Temple of Confucius recently burned down. That is why, for the last five or six years, floods and droughts in uneasy sequence have ravaged much of China, so that crops have been lost, the balance between hot and cold seasons has been destroyed, "mountains collapsed, rivers dried up." That is why "the five stars converged," "the Yellow River flowed clear," "yin was exhausted and yang began to rise." </p><p>In some passages, the letter's author reflects on the imbalances of a social order in which "the land has all been taken over by the rich-the rich get richer every day, and the poor get poorer." Summer Calm clearly separates himself from these wealthy families: "Living in the present day, and making my way in the present world, I have no intention of seeking profit or rank-these would defile me." Perhaps he is a farmer? "I live in seclusion on an empty mountain, with one or two like-minded friends, raising our chickens and growing melons." Yet if he is a farmer, he cares for old texts, old days, and has a sense of history. For the writer of this letter, nothing good in a scholarly or political sense has happened in China during the five centuries that have passed since the fall of that Song dynasty which Yue Fei fought so hard to preserve. In all that time, up to the present, only one scholar has "upheld the ideal," and that was the man whom the letter writer calls "The Master of the Eastern Sea." </p><p>As to the reigning emperor, Yongzheng, Summer Calm expresses nothing but disgust, and for General Yue's benefit he marshals the negative arguments: the emperor under whose rule they both are living has murdered several of his brothers, both older and younger; he has plotted against his parents; he persecutes his loyal ministers, and gives his ear only to sycophants; he is greedy for material gain, despite the richness with which he lives; he is ever eager to kill others, often drinks himself into oblivion, and cannot control his sexual passions. Could anyone be surprised that "the sky is shaking, the earth is angry; demons cry, gods howl"? </p><p>It is early afternoon by the time Yue Zhongqi finishes the letter. It has not been hard to read the letter in privacy, but many people have seen the letter delivered into his hands, and he must proceed with care. He will need unimpeachable witnesses if he is to question the messenger. If he were to investigate such an incredible document on his own, or to question the messenger in secret, even if he were to get the truth would anyone believe him? </p><p>The last time Yue Zhongqi found himself in a somewhat similar predicament was around fifteen months before, in early August 1727, when he was serving as the commanding general in the city of Chengdu, down in the southwest in Sichuan province. Just after noon, on August 4, a man was seen running wildly through the streets. He carried a stone in each hand, and shouted out for all to hear that a great upheaval was coming, that "Old Yue" would rise up with his cavalry and troops in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces to overthrow the government. Within the very walls of Chengdu itself, secretly organized gangs would arise at the same time from their hidden bases near the city gates and would begin a bout of random killings. </p><p>That the city watchmen who first reported the incident and Yue's senior colleagues who investigated it all thought the man was mad was little solace to Yue Zhongqi himself. He still had to report the whole humiliating incident to the emperor, for he knew that his colleagues-even those among them he considered his friends-would be reporting it as well. Trivial though the incident might seem, both their careers and his depended on never concealing a single act that might be seen to threaten the regime. As Yue rather bitterly noted in his report to the emperor at that time, "If people are truly mad, there is nothing they cannot say, and no person they cannot destroy." And in a follow-up report Yue poured out his sense of anguish and guilt, lambasting himself for his failures as a general and as an official, confessing to financial and administrative errors and to mistakes in judgment, repeatedly referring to his own weakening health, and finally requesting to be relieved of all his duties. </p><p>Responding to Yue's reports in an edict issued later that same summer of 1727, Emperor Yongzheng handled the whole matter of the Chengdu incident with candor. Over the years, wrote the emperor, he had received numerous warnings of Yue Zhongqi's potential for disloyalty, warnings that were often linked to rumors that the general might seek to relive the triumphs of his ancestor Yue Fei. As emperor, he chose to ignore them all, and indeed had promoted Yue to ever-higher positions out of absolute confidence that the charges were groundless. His only regret was that these scurrilous accusations demeaned not only General Yue himself but also the loyal people of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, who formed the backbone of Yue's armies. </p><p>In a separate set of confidential comments for the general's eyes only, written in vermilion ink between the columns of Yue's impassioned outpourings, the emperor reassured Yue that he considered the charges Yue was directing against himself to be basically trivial matters, unworthy of further consideration. No one had mentioned them to the emperor before, and he did not care to know about them now. Yue should stay at his post, and get on with the work he had been appointed to do. Yue's poor health, however, was a real concern. Accordingly the emperor would send his own most trusted court doctor, Liu Yuduo, down to Chengdu, with a range of the medicines for which he was justly famous, to give Yue a thorough examination. Dr. Liu did indeed arrive in Chengdu, and spent three days checking the general's pulse rhythms, and in experimenting with different dosages of medication, before hitting on a formula that suited the general perfectly, brought an end to his nagging anxieties, and rebuilt his bodily strength. </p><p>Since the Chengdu case might leave rumors hovering in the air, rumors that could damage Yue's reputation and encourage doubts in the public's mind about the tranquillity of the region, Emperor Yongzheng also appointed a special investigator from the Ministry of Punishments to travel down to Chengdu and check things out for himself. Arriving in mid-September 1727, the investigator personally questioned the alleged madman, along with his relatives, anyone who had shared lodgings with him, and the members of the patrol that arrested him. The rigorous questioning-some of it under torture-revealed no instigators behind the scenes, and no traces of a concealed plot. It was clear that the madman, Lu, had acted alone while in a delirium caused by a protracted bout of malaria that had lasted over a month, leaving him weakened and desiccated. Lu had no memory at all of his actions in the street on that early August day. If there was any calculation behind his words and actions, it was that he had been driven to a state approaching madness even earlier, during a protracted struggle with the authorities to regain some land he had sold, under duress, to a brutal neighbor. The refusal of the various officials in the countryside where he lived to reopen his case had led Lu at last to Chengdu, in the hopes of catching the attention of the recently appointed general, Yue, who had a reputation for fairness. The investigator in 1727 also clarified some puzzling details in the case: for instance, Lu had been carrying a stone in each hand to drive away the wild dogs that followed him through the streets; the wildness of his gaze sprang from the delirium that fixed his eyes in an unyielding stare; once placed in a cart by the watchmen, to be conveyed to the city jail, all his energy evaporated, and he fell at once into a deep and trancelike sleep. </p><p>Yue Zhongqi was lucky that time, and apparently the case left no lingering resentments. But how can Yue report yet another case, of an oddly similar kind, not much more than a year after that earlier one, and still retain his emperor's confidence? His main hope for imperial understanding must be to keep the record limpidly clear, to have no suggestion of any hidden double-dealing. Only testimony from the most impeccable corroborating sources can be used. Lowly witnesses obviously will not do-for this is treason of the gravest kind. Twice Yue Zhongqi sends members of his personal staff to the second-ranking official in Shaanxi province, Governor Xilin, who also resides in Xi'an, asking him to report at once to the general's office. But the governor replies that he cannot come-he is out at the military training grounds in the northeastern part of the city, checking the martial skills of those taking the current round of military examinations. It would not be tactful in the circumstances for General Yue to order Governor Xilin to come, since the governor is a career Manchu bureaucrat, only one grade junior to General Yue, and the training ground is in the very middle of the "Manchu city" of Xi'an. That Manchu enclave was formed from the entire eastern half of the city after it was seized from the Chinese residents in 1646, fortified with its own inner walls, and made the permanent and protected residence area for five thousand Manchu garrison troops along with their more than fifteen thousand dependents. </p><p>Dipping, of necessity, one rung down in the bureaucratic hierarchy, Yue Zhongqi calls instead on the third-ranking official stationed in Xi'an, Judicial Commissioner Shise. This man's office is just across the road from the governor-general's compound, beside that same Drum Tower where the messenger had been waiting, and as it happens Shise is free, and is able to respond to Yue's call. After the two officials have consulted together briefly, Yue installs the commissioner in a room adjacent to the main office, so that he can hear everything that transpires ...</p></p><h2>Peter Rabbit Easter Egg Hunt</h2><p>Easter springs up brightly and vividly in this interactive novelty book.

From a single store, it grew to more than 15,000 by 1927. Further, the chain was among the first to foresee the development of supermarkets in the 1930s and '40s. But with the death of the founder's sons and no family member to take over, A &amp; P went public in 1959 and has declined steadily since. In 1979, it was sold to a German entrepreneur who shortly thereafter "restructured" its employee pension plan, making $400 million in the process. The Hartfords, Walsh believes, succeeded because they had an idea, a dream, and those who followed failed because they did not.

He currently lives in Oregon, working as a translator and helping his wife, Cristina, educate their two children at home. <i>The Ten Thousand</i> is his first novel.The ill-fated campaign of Xenophon's army in the political chaos following the Peloponnesian War is the subject of Ford's debut, a long and labyrinthine affair that begins with the army's successful journey to Babylon and an initial battle in which the Persian forces are routed. But the tide quickly turns when the Persians sneak behind enemy lines and pillage the Greek camp, leaving Xenophon's army stranded hundreds of miles from home with few supplies. Rather than starve by taking the desert route back, Xenophon decides to attempt a perilous journey through hostile enemy terrain populated by several dangerous tribes, and as they progress the Greeks are forced to endure a horrific series of hardship just to survive. The more intriguing scenes: the Greeks use a tribe of deadly slingshot artists to defeat a formidable enemy; they get waylaid by a cache of poisonous honey; a winter march results in the death of dozens of soldiers . The major subplot in the book narrated by Xenophon's alter ego, Themostigenes (nicknamed Theo) concerns the protagonist's adventurous but tortured affair with a royal Persian woman named Asteria who is traveling with the Greek army, and whom he saves from death during battle. Ford has some compelling material, and his account includes authentic details about ancient peoples, customs and battle strategies. But his melodramatic, turgid prose produces a rather monotonous story delivered in heroic overtones, with little feel for pace, no true climax and a dearth of fully realized characters. The result is a novel that fails to live up to its subject's potential.

It is an exciting, dramatic 200-year-old history which begins grimly with the &#34;starving time&#34; in the Virginia colony in 1609 and ends, mercifully enough, with the peaceful resolution of the Othello affair with the French in 1807. But, in between these two very different events lies a full panoply of grisly and bizarre buccaneering incidents one is hard pressed to imagine from the vantage point of the late twentieth century. For example, twice in the 1600&#39;s large Dutch fleets sailed boldly into the Chesapeake attacking and burning. Then there was the French pirate chief Lewis Guittar who crossed swords with a Virginia colonial governor, a duel which ended in a climactic sea battle in Lynnhaven Bay. Having completed impressive research in the archives of the Netherlands, England, and United States, Shomette skillfully reconstructs these episodes and many others, including the intensive anti-pirate cruises to capture - dead or alive - the notorious Blackbeard. The anti-pirate cruises led to the roundup of dozens of pirates and some showy executions but did little to curb the continued terrorist activities of bandits like Roger Makeele, Stede Bonnet, and Joseph Wheland.

In <i>Born to Walk,</i> author James Earls explores the mystery of our evolution by describing in depth the mechanisms that allow us to be efficient in bipedal gait. Viewing the whole body as an interconnected unit, Earls explains how we can regain a flowing efficiency within our gait--an efficiency which, he argues, is part of our natural design.<br><br>This book is designed for movement therapy practitioners, physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, massage therapists, and any bodyworker wishing to help clients by incorporating an understanding of gait and its mechanics. It will also appeal to anyone with an interest in evolution and movement.<br><br>Drawing on recent research from paleoanthropology, sports science, and anatomy, Earls proposes a complete model of how the whole body cooperates in this three dimensional action. His work is based on Thomas Myers's Anatomy Trains model of human anatomy, a holistic view of the human body that emphasizes fascial and myofascial connections.<br><br>Earls distills the complex action of walking into a simple sequence of "essential events" or actions that are necessary to engage the myofascia and utilize its full potential in the form of elastic energy. He explains the "stretch-shortening cycle"--the mechanism that is the basis for many normal human activities--and discusses how humans take advantage of isometric contractions, viscoelastic response, and elastic recoil to minimize calorie usage.

The daughter of noted transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and Abigail May Alcott, Alcott was an active abolitionist and feminist, and the first woman registered to vote in Concord, Massachusetts. Schooled mainly by her father, Alcott and her three sisters also received lessons from such notables as Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Fuller. Alcott penned her first book, Flower Fables, for Emerson s daughter, Ellen. Before gaining critical success for her children s fiction, Alcott wrote several passionate adult novels using the pen name A. M. Barnard, including A Long Fatal Love Chase and Punishment. Alcott s literary career spanned more than 40 years, and she wrote more than 30 books before her death in 1888.Grade 6 Up-At the age of 13, Rose finds herself orphaned and living with two elderly aunts on "Aunt Hill" where she is treated as delicately as the flower for which she is named. But Rose soon finds her quiet world turned upside down with the arrival of her seven boisterous boy cousins followed by her Uncle Alec, a doctor and a world traveler. Upon meeting Rose, Uncle Alec quickly prescribes fresh air and much activity to help with the girl's poor constitution. Uncle Alec's diagnosis turns out to be an accurate one and Rose, with the help of her cousins, finds herself in the middle of much hijinx and merriment. Veteran stage actress Barbara Caruso brilliantly breaths life into each and every one of Louisa May Alcott's delightful characters. With just the slightest change of inflection she is able to capture the essence of each character from the oldest to the very youngest.

But it is questionable whether it is being obeyed to a comparable degree,&#34; says Douglas Moo in the preface to his commentary on James. &#34;All this suggests that the message of James is one that we all need to hear--and obey. No profound theologian, James&#39; genius lied in his profound moral earnestness; in his powerfully simple call for repentance, for action, for a consistent Christian lifestyle. His words need to thrust through our theological debates, our personal preconceptions, our spiritual malaise and set us back on the road to a biblical, invigorating, transforming Christianity.&#34; The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world&#39;s most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable, and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament. These Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date, and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>Douglas J. Moo (PhD, University of St. Andrews) is the Kenneth T. Wessner Professor of New Testament at Wheaton College Graduate School. He has written numerous New Testament commentaries for the NIV Application Commentary series and the Tyndale New Testament Commentary series, specifically on the Pauline and general letters. Since 2006, he has chaired the Committee on Bible Translation, the group of scholars charged with revising the text of the NIV, and is the coauthor of <em>The Rapture: Pre-, Mid-, or Post-Tribulational?</em> and <em>The Law, the Gospel, and the Modern Christian: Five Views.</em>"The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The evenness and quality of this series are remarkable."

With this foundation laid, the reader is then equipped to work with the fungi directly. Techniques for making potent fungal medicines, growing fermenting fungi for food, and cheaply cultivating mushrooms using recycled tools (and yet still achieving lab-quality results) are explored in-depth. Subsequent chapters grow far beyond the limits of other books on mushrooms. Detailed information on the principles and practices of what McCoy calls &#34;regenerative natural mushroom farming&#34; is presented along with extensive information on cultivating mycorrhizal fungi and the science of mycoremediation (the application of fungi to mitigate pollution in our homes and environment). Concluding the book are deeper insights into the cultural effects that fungi present, from a philosophical reflection of fungal growth in the design of human societies, to an exhaustive examination of the history of psychoactive mushrooms.</p><p></p><h2>Pathfinder Adventure Path: Mummy&#39;s Mask Part 5 - The Slave Trenches of Hakotep</h2><p><ul> <li>The Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I has risen and launched an attack against the city of Wati with his infamous flying pyramid.

By the author of The Question of Animal Awareness.</p><p>In 1945, Donald Griffin was one of the codiscoverers of echolocation by bats. In the 1980s he became a leader of cognitive ethnology--the study of animals' thinking behavior--"forging a path where others fear to tread or cannot see a way," in the words of Gerald Durrell. <i>Animal Minds</i> is Griffin's most strongly argued summary of the evidence for cognition from every corner of the animal kingdom. This is a manifesto that "cognitive ethology presents us with one of the supreme scientific challenges of our times," and is required reading for anyone interested in the nature and distribution of minds.In his latest elaboration on the theme of animal thought and consciousness, Griffin (an associate of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology) is intent on laying to rest the ghosts of behaviorism. Griffin sees the vehement denials of consciousness to any but human animals on the part of contemporary ethologists and cognitive psychologists as the lingering heritage of reductionist thinking in psychology. In order to put psychology on a sound scientific basis, the behaviorists argued, all speculation on what went on inside the black box in the head had to be banned. As in his Animal Thinking (1984), here Griffin elaborates many examples to suggest that a lot does go on even in the ``minds'' of bees and ants. So, rather than prove that animal awareness and self-awareness exist, he cites numerous examples of what might be considered surrogates of consciousness--plans, deceptions, communications, tool uses, etc. The result is a wonderful catalogue of animal behaviors. Some are familiar: chimps fashioning sticks to poke termites from nests; otters using stones to break open shells. Others are less familiar: bees changing their dance in light of a sister bee's signals of an even better source of food; a vervet monkey giving the cry that signifies ``leopard'' to rout the competition from disputed turf. Since there's so little understanding about the neural substrate of human consciousness, it's unlikely that arguments from animal observations will convince die-hard reductionists. Instead, Griffin, whose observations of echolation in bats have earned him high honors in animal science, can be credited with opening a path that invites others to blaze new trails in the quest for consciousness in all animals, human and otherwise. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They eventually marry and have three children, bringing them up in a hot-house atmosphere of music and maths, hoping to raise them to have no awareness of race as an issue in their lives. All three are musically talented, but they cannot be protected from the world for long. Jonah becomes a successful young tenor, but the world of opera can only accept him as a &#39;brilliant Negro singer&#39;; Joseph, our narrator, becomes a pianist and devotes his talents to the service of his brother&#39;s; Ruth turns her back on classical music (&#39;white music&#39;) and disappears, on the run with her black husband under suspicion of being a Black Panther. Powers brilliantly and devastatingly delineates the tragedy of race in America, as it unfolds from the Civil Rights movement to Rodney King and Louis Farrakhan, through the lives and choices of one family, caught on the cusp of identities. This is a hugely ambitious - and brilliantly achieved - novel, as brilliantly clever as Powers&#39; previous novels, but also deeply political and deeply moving.</p><p>In some respects, Richard Powers's <i>The Time of Our Singing</i> is just a big, absorbing drama about an American family, with the typical ingredients of an immigrant parent and some social obstacles--in this case, a biracial marriage in the Civil Rights era--to be overcome by the talented children. But Powers's lyrical gifts lift this material far above its familiar subject matter. His descriptions of music alone will transport the reader. The Strom family were raised with this common language: "Our parents' Crazed Quotations game played on the notion that every moment's tune had all history's music box for its counterpoint. On any evening in Hamilton Heights, we could jump from organum to atonality without any hint of all the centuries that had died fiery deaths between them." The central figure of this novel is the dazzling Jonah, who makes a life from singing, and who may be the only person around him who regards his racial heritage as irrelevant to his ambitions. Powers's is such a fertile writer, however, that he can't stay with any single story, but plunges into pages and pages of family and social histories. The result is a rambling, resonant, fearless novel that pulls the reader along in its wake. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Richard Powers is a recipient of a MacArthur award (commonly referred to as &#39;genius grants&#39;).

Incorporating countless interviews with rock personalities that he has conducted over the last three decades, <b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b> follows rock's road of creative flashpoints, but diverges, too, to explore the fundamental traditions that have helped define both the music and its culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a corresponding chapter to each part in the series, <b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b> shows how people, places, and events from rock "gods" to little known session musicians, from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to the far reaches of West Africa shaped and defined the music's most important epochs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, to give rock the more in-depth analysis that it deserves, Palmer has written three additional essays "I Put a Spell on You," "Delinquents of Heaven, Hoodlums from Hell," and "The Church of the Sonic Guitar" which&nbsp;&nbsp;respectively explore the rudiments of rhythm, the ritual of rebellion, and the story of the "six-string" in rock. <br><br>In <b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b>, Robert Palmer traces rock's ongoing evolution, showing how its many styles and early influences from blues and gospel to reggae, punk, and rap overlap and distinguish themselves from one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than one hundred and fifty illustrations,&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b> is the best of the two primary approaches to rock and roll history the history of innovative flashpoints, and the history of an ongoing tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;As told through the senses and lifelong&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences of one of rock's preeminent critics, <b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b> is the most insightful and intelligent history of rock ever written.</p><p><b>Robert Palmer</b> was the <b>New York Times</b>'s first full-time rock writer and chief pop critic (1976-1988) and has been a contributing editor at <b>Rolling Stone</b> since the early seventies.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has taught courses in American music at Yale, Carnegie-Mellon, Bowdoin, the University of Mississippi, and Brooklyn College, where he was the first Senior Research Fellow of the Institute for Studies in American Music to teach and write a musicological monograph on rock and roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the author of <b>Deep Blues</b> and other books, and served as writer and music director for two award-winning documentary films, <b>The World According to John Coltrane</b> and <b>Deep Blues</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since producing the latter film's sound track CD for Atlantic Records, he has produced a number of raw juke joint blues CDs for the Fat Possum label, winning a number of polls and awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;He acted as the chief advisor to the ten-part WGBH/BBC series.Rolling Stone rock-writer Palmer has authored a selective, personalized history of rock'n'roll that loosely serves as a companion to the PBS/BBC television series on the same topic. He offers ten chapters of uneven quality, including a good explanation of rock's origins, an almost needless chapter about Bob Dylan circa 1965, a look at psychedelia that omits leading San Francisco bands, and a weak concluding chapter on rap and metal. Clearly more comfortable with blues and its direct descendants, Palmer downplays or ignores MTV, Michael Jackson, the Mersey Beat British Invasion, early Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, The Who, grunge, and hardcore punk. Further confusing this "history," Palmer intersperses three thematic essays between the chronologically organized chapters: a detailed account of the African and Cuban antecedents of rock; a less-than-compelling look at rock's dangerous side; and an excellent, previously published examination of the electric guitar. Considering his past accomplishments (the indispensable Deep Blues, LJ 5/15/81) and his many interviews with musicians, Palmer has provided a disappointing book that adds little to rock histories currently available.

On a clear morning in mid-June, Lord John Grey emerges from London's Beefsteak Club, his mind in turmoil.

Jeanine Basinger argues that they were both at the same time. She maintains that they freed their female protagonists to break social bonds while also punishing any women who seemed too free and feisty. This lively and exceedingly thorough book covers every major aspect of this fascinating film genre, including the roles female stars were expected to play, the fabulous clothes they wore, the social behaviors they were condemned to adopt, the ways they responded to and were treated by men, and the ideals of femininity Hollywood producers tried to impress upon their audiences. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i>6 1/8 x 9 1/4 trim. 46 illus.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><b>1. ROSELAND</b> <p>The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside the swimming pool might have been dead.</p> <p>He might have been drowned and fished out of the pool and laid out on the grass to dry while the police or the next-of-kin were summoned. Even the little pile of objects in the grass beside his head might have been his personal effects, meticulously assembled in full view so that no one should think that something had been stolen by his rescuers.</p> <p>To judge by the glittering pile, this had been, or was, a rich man. It contained the typical membership badges of the rich man's club - a money clip, made of a Mexican fifty-dollar piece and holding a substantial wad of banknotes, a well-used gold Dunhill lighter, an oval gold cigarette case with the wavy ridges and discreet turquoise button that means Faberge, and the sort of novel a rich man pulls out of the bookcase to take into the garden - The Little Nugget - an old P.G. Wodehouse. There was also a bulky gold wristwatch on a well-used brown crocodile strap. It was a Girard-Perregaux model designed for people who like gadgets, and it had a sweep second-hand and two little windows in the face to tell the day of the month, and the month, and the phase of the moon. The story it now told was 2.30 on June 10th with the moon three-quarters full.</p> <p>A blue and green dragon-fly flashed out from among the rose bushes at the end of the garden and hovered in mid-air a few inches above the base of the man's spine. It had been attracted by the golden shimmer of the June sunshine on the ridge of fine blond hairs above the coccyx. A puff of breeze came off the sea. The tiny field of hairs bent gently. The dragonfly darted nervously sideways and hung above the man's left shoulder, looking down. The young grass below the man's open mouth stirred. A large drop of sweat rolled down the side of the fleshy nose and dropped glittering into the grass. That was enough. The dragonfly flashed away through the roses and over the jagged glass on top of the high garden wall. It might be good food, but it moved.</p> <p>The garden in which the man lay was about an acre of well-kept lawn surrounded on three sides by thickly banked rose bushes from which came the steady murmur of bees. Behind the drowsy noise of the bees the sea boomed softly at the bottom of the cliff at the end of the garden.</p> <p>There was no view of the sea from the garden - no view of anything except of the sky and the clouds above the twelve-foot wall. In fact you could only see out of the property from the two upstairs bedrooms of the villa that formed the fourth side of this very private enclosure. From them you could see a great expanse of blue water in front of you and, on either side, the upper windows of neighbouring villas and the tops of the trees in their gardens - Mediterranean-type evergreen oaks, stone pines, casuarinas and an occasional palm tree.</p> <p>The villa was modern - a squat elongated box without ornament. On the garden side the flat pink-washed facade was pierced by four iron-framed windows and by a central glass door leading on to a small square of pale green glazed tiles. The tiles merged into the lawn. The other side of the villa, standing back a few yards from a dusty road, was almost identical. But on this side the four windows were barred, and the central door was of oak.</p> <p>The villa had two medium-sized bedrooms on the upper floor and on the ground floor a sitting-room and a kitchen, part of which was walled off into a lavatory. There was no bathroom.</p> <p>The drowsy luxurious silence of early afternoon was broken by the sound of a car coming down the road. It stopped in front of the villa. There was the tinny clang of a car door being slammed and the car drove on. The doorbell rang twice. The naked man beside the swimming pool did not move, but, at the noise of the bell and of the departing car, his eyes had for an instant opened very wide. It was as if the eyelids had pricked up like an animal's ears. The man immediately remembered where he was and the day of the week and the time of the day. The noises were identified. The eyelids with their fringe of short sandy eyelashes drooped drowsily back over the very pale blue, opaque, inward-looking eyes. The small cruel lips opened in a wide jaw-breaking yawn which brought saliva into the mouth. The man spat the saliva into the grass and waited.</p> <p>A young woman carrying a small string bag and dressed in a white cotton shirt and a short, unalluring blue skirt came through the glass door and strode mannishly across the glazed tiles and the stretch of lawn towards the naked man. A few yards away from him, she dropped her string bag on the grass and sat down and took off her cheap and rather dusty shoes. Then she stood up and unbuttoned her shirt and took it off and put it, neatly folded, beside the string bag.</p> <p>The girl had nothing on under the shirt. Her skin was pleasantly sunburned and her shoulders and fine breasts shone with health. When she bent her arms to undo the side-buttons of her skirt, small tufts of fair hair showed in her armpits. The impression of a healthy animal peasant girl was heightened by the chunky hips in faded blue stockinet bathing trunks and the thick short thighs and legs that were revealed when she had stripped.</p> <p>The girl put the skirt neatly beside her shirt, opened the string bag, took out an old soda-water bottle containing some heavy colourless liquid and went over to the man and knelt on the grass beside him. She poured some of the liquid, a light olive oil, scented, as was everything in that part of the world, with roses, between his shoulder blades and, after flexing her fingers like a pianist, began massaging the sternomastoid and the trapezius muscles at the back of the man's neck.</p> <p>It was hard work. The man was immensely strong and the bulging muscles at the base of the neck hardly yielded to the girl's thumbs even when the downward weight of her shoulders was behind them. By the time she was finished with the man she would be soaked in perspiration and so utterly exhausted that she would fall into the swimming pool and then lie down in the shade and sleep until the car came for her. But that wasn't what she minded as her hands worked automatically on across the man's back. It was her instinctive horror for the finest body she had ever seen.</p> <p>None of this horror showed in the flat, impassive face of the masseuse, and the upward-slanting black eyes under the fringe of short coarse black hair were as empty as oil slicks, but inside her the animal whimpered and cringed and her pulse-rate, if it had occurred to her to take it, would have been high.</p> <p>Once again, as so often over the past two years, she wondered why she loathed this splendid body, and once again she vaguely tried to analyse her revulsion. Perhaps this time she would get rid of feelings which she felt guiltily certain were much more unprofessional than the sexual desire some of her patients awoke in her.</p> <p>To take the small things first: his hair. She looked down at the round, smallish head on the sinewy neck. It was covered with tight red-gold curls that should have reminded her pleasantly of the formalised hair in the pictures she had seen of classical statues. But the curls were somehow too tight, too thickly pressed against each other and against the skull. They set her teeth on edge like fingernails against pile carpet. And the golden curls came down so low into the back of the neck - almost (she thought in professional terms) to the fifth cervical vertebra. And there they stopped abruptly in a straight line of small stiff golden hairs.</p> <p>The girl paused to give her hands a rest and sat back on her haunches. The beautiful upper half of her body was already shining with sweat. She wiped the back of her forearm across her forehead and reached for the bottle of oil. She poured about a tablespoonful on to the small furry plateau at the base of the man's spine, flexed her fingers and bent forward again.</p> <p>This embryo tail of golden down above the cleft of the buttocks - in a lover it would have been gay, exciting, but on this man it was somehow bestial. No, reptilian. But snakes had no hair. Well, she couldn't help that. It seemed reptilian to her. She shifted her hands on down to the two mounds of the gluteal muscles. Now was the time when many of her patients, particularly the young ones on the football team, would start joking with her. Then, if she was not very careful, the suggestions would come. Sometimes she could silence these by digging sharply down towards the sciatic nerve. At other times, and particularly if she found the man attractive, there would be giggling arguments, a brief wrestling-match and a quick, delicious surrender.</p> <p>With this man it was different, almost uncannily different. From the very first he had been like a lump of inanimate meat. In two years he had never said a word to her. When she had done his back and it was time for him to turn over, neither his eyes nor his body had once shown the smallest interest in her. When she tapped his shoulder, he would just roll over and gaze at the sky through half-closed lids and occasionally let out one of the long shuddering yawns that were the only sign that he had human reactions at all.</p> <p>The girl shifted her position and slowly worked down the right leg towards the Achilles tendon. When she came to it, she looked back up the fine body. Was her revulsion only physical? Was it the reddish colour of the sunburn on the naturally milk-white skin, the sort of roast meat look? Was it the texture of the skin itself, the deep, widely spaced pores in the satiny surface? The thickly scattered orange freckles on the shoulders? Or was it the sexuality of the man? The indifference of these splendid, insolently bulging muscles? Or was it spiritual - an animal instinct telling her that inside this wonderful body there was an evil person?</p> <p>The masseuse got to her feet and stood, twisting her head slowly from side to side and flexing her shoulders. She stretched her arms out s...</p></p><h2>The Town in Bloom</h2><p>A determined young Lancashire girl arrives in London intent on a stage career - this tale from the author of &#34;I Capture the Castle&#34; is told with the candour and authenticity that derives from Dodie Smith&#39;s own experience of the theatre world. Mouse never did fully suit her nickname. Tiny she may have been, but timid never. After less than twenty-four hours in London she had bluffed her way into an audition at a famous theatre, infuriated its forceful young stage director, and amused its kind if quite amoral actor-manager. She had finally landed not a part but a toehold as a junior secretary. During her involvement in the engrossing affairs of the Crossway Theatre she met her friends Molly, a baby-faced six-footer; and elegant, ambitious Lilian, who was fated to clash disastrously with Mouse.

After training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she went on to become a remarkably unsuccessful actress. Later she became a playwright and this time achieved considerable acclaim. She achieved enduring success with her first novel, I Capture the Castle<i>, </i>which was recently voted #82 in 'the nation's 100 best-loved novels' as part of the BBC's Big Read. Her children's book The Hundred and One Dalmatians was made into a cartoon film by Walt Disney.This is a book one can truly love.</p><h2>Larz and Isabel Anderson</h2><p><p>Larz and Isabel Anderson were wealthy socialites whose extraordinary lives spanned a century of American history-from the Civil War to World War II. Their world included dozens of celebrities who helped define modern culture and politics: Henry and Clover Adams, Alice Pike Barney, Cecilia Beaux, Lord and Lady Curzon, Maud Howe Elliott, Henry James, Isabella Stewart Gardner, Robert Todd Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, John Singer Sargent, and William Howard Taft.</p><p>In his dual biography based on six years of archival research, Stephen Moskey offers a fresh look into America's Gilded Age while focusing not just on the lives of the Andersons, but also on the intersection of wealth, celebrity, politics, gender, and race as one century ended and another began. While leading others back in time, Moskey shines a light on Larz's professional achievements as well as Isabel's emergence as an American woman of the early modern era whose words and deeds anticipated women's roles in culture and society today.</p><p><em>Larz and Isabel Anderson</em> shares the story of a glittering Gilded Age couple as they lived, worked, prospered, and gave back during a fascinating time in America's history.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Way of Solomon: Finding Joy and Contentment in the Wisdom of Ecclesiastes</h2><p><p>"Thus I understand the simple truth of life:<br>There is nothing better than for you to rejoice<br>in every deed done in harmony with the moment. <br>For doing is your purpose;<br>in doing is your meaning.<br>Leave the result to those who come after you,<br>and attend solely to doing well that which must be done at all."<br></p><p>In this thoughtful, fresh interpretation, Rami Shapiro presents King Solomon's philosophy as that of a Taoist sage and the book of Ecclesiastes not as a lamentation of life's vanities and meaninglessness but as a guide to reality and how to embrace it with joy and tranquility. Shapiro's Ecclesiastes shows modern spiritual seekers the way to truth, gratitude, contentment, and joy.</p><p>Traditional translations of Ecclesiastes dampen the hopeful spirit of Solomon's message, while Shapiro's rendition illuminates an ancient wisdom as timely and relevant today as ever. Shapiro boldly asserts that Solomon didn't in fact cry "vanity of vanities," as his words are so often translated, but rather, "Emptiness, emptiness, all is emptiness." Read this way, the message becomes a meditation on the promise of finding joy in even the most ordinary of daily acts and true peace of mind in our contemporary world of ego and artificial distractions.</p><p>Positioning Solomon as a realist with the instincts of a Zen master who seeks a path away from illusion and toward true enlightenment, Shapiro presents an innovative, engaging translation of the full text, and then lingers over the most moving and important passages, offering real-world examples of how this classic book of wisdom can be incorporated into our own lives. Solomon beseeches us to accept impermanence in order to embrace the present with freshness of body and mind. He calls on us to engage each moment, lest we miss today by agonizing about yesterday or daydreaming about tomorrow. And he urges us to recognize and celebrate the interdependence of all things, so that we may act justly and compassionately.</p><p>Shapiro's passion for the timeless message of Ecclesiastes is evident throughout The Way of Solomon. He encourages us to read with open minds and hearts, to savor the wisdom of this ever-popular book of the Bible, to consider its implications carefully for our own lives, and to commit ourselves to testing its truth against our own experiences.</p></p><p><i>The Way of Solomon: Finding Joy and Contentment in the Wisdom of Ecclesiastes</i> is Rami Shapiro's new interpretation of one of the Bible's oldest books. Shapiro's fascination with Ecclesiastes began when he discovered that the Hebrew word commonly translated as "vanity" could also mean "empty." For Shapiro, this discovery added a new and Eastern dimension to Solomon's famous line, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" and drove Shapiro to engage the book of Ecclesiastes in a holistic way. "Solomon looked and saw that all was empty of permanence; and that so much of our energies are invested in a pursuit of permanence that is doomed from the start. Ecclesiastes is his report of his journey to the heart of reality, and his insights into how we should live given the facts of life's impermanence. The only way to do justice to the text is to follow its author in looking at reality," he explains. <i>The Way of Solomon</i> includes Shapiro's translation of Ecclesiastes, notes from his wide-ranging research on the text, and reflections on his practice of meditation with Ecclesiastes. In Shapiro's hands, Ecclesiastes becomes something that many, many Christians are looking for these days--a kind of missing link between Buddhism and Christianity.Rami Shapiro is the senior rabbi of Temple Beth Or in Miami and directs the Simply Jewish Fellowship, the What Would a Mentsch Do? Project, and the Sh'ma Center for Jewish Meditation.

He lives with his wife, Gloria, in New York City.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>EXACTLY THIRTY-THREE HOURS and forty-seven minutes after he had last been in church, Michael Murphy was hurtling through a terrible dark abyss. Prayer had never seemed more necessary to him than at that moment. In pitch blackness, with the only sound the whoosh of his body falling through the air, Murphy had no idea where he was heading.<br><br>Except down. Quickly. All six feet three inches of him.<br><br>Just a moment ago, Murphy had been standing on the rooftop of what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse on a desolate street in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was an unusual place for him to be on a Monday night during the university semester, when he normally would be preparing for his next day&#x2019;s lecture.<br><br>Yet it took only one word to make him drop all normal activities and race to this dank and deserted height. Granted, that word was in Aramaic, one of the many ancient languages Michael Murphy could read with some fluency.<br><br>The Aramaic letters had been penned with elaborate style in a bright blue ink that had seeped deeply into a thick, expensive ivory-tinted paper stock that had been wrapped with great care and tied up by a translucent ribbon around a heavy stone.<br><br>A stone that came crashing through the lower window of Murphy&#x2019;s campus office late that afternoon.<br><br>Whoever threw the stone into his office had disappeared by the time Murphy got to the window. As he unwrapped the paper and translated the single word that appeared there, he first stared, then began to count.<br><br>Thirty seconds until his office phone rang. He knew what voice he would hear at the other end of the line, although he had never seen the face to go with that voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Methuselah, you old scoundrel.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a high cackling laugh in answer, a sound Murphy would recognize anywhere. &#x201c;Oh, Murphy, you never disappoint me. I take it I&#x2019;ve piqued your interest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And cost me a replacement window.&#x201d; He looked down again at the single word on the paper. &#x201c;Is this for real?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Murphy, have I ever let you down?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope. You&#x2019;ve tried your weird best to kill me several times, but let me down, never. When and where?&#x201d;<br><br>The cackling now was replaced by a tongue-clucking. &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t rush me, Murphy. My rules. My time. My game. But trust me, this will be the best ever. For me, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then, I assume that, as before, no sane man would take you up on this challenge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only an eager lad like yourself. But as always, you have my word. You survive, you get what you came for. And trust me, you&#x2019;ll want to survive for this prize.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I always want to survive, Methuselah. Unlike yourself, to me life is a precious thing.&#x201d;<br><br>The old man snorted. &#x201c;Not so precious that you won&#x2019;t come sniffing like an eager dog after this bone I&#x2019;ve just tossed you. But enough chatter. Tonight. Nine-seventeen. Be on the roof of the warehouse at Eighty-three Cutter Place in Raleigh. And take my advice, Murphy boy. If you do come, and I know you will, make the most of these last few hours.&#x201d;<br><br>With another cackle, the line went dead.<br><br>Murphy shook his head, put down the receiver, and picked up the paper. He double-checked his translation. This time, the name he read set his mind racing even faster than before.<br><br>For Michael Murphy, a scholar who could not confine himself to library stacks of dusty, ancient tomes, an archaeologist dedicated to hunting and rescuing artifacts that could authenticate events from the pages of the Bible, this was the name of the prophet who was guaranteed to intrigue him more than any other:<br>D A N I E L<br>For the rest of the day, Murphy could think of little else besides speculating about his nighttime rendezvous with Methuselah. It had been approximately two years since Murphy had first been contacted by this eccentric figure. Each time, without warning, and without ever showing his face, Methuselah would get a message to Murphy, always a single word in an ancient language that would turn out to be the name of one of the books of the Bible.<br><br>This would be followed within a minute by cryptic directions, always to some deserted location, where Methuselah would watch from a secure hiding place and taunt him while Murphy would try to survive some very real, very deadly physical challenge.<br><br>The risk of death was very high and very real each time. Methuselah was seemingly as serious about his sadistic games as he was about the scholarship behind his finds. And apparently he had enough money not only to sponsor the acquiring of the artifacts but to indulge his wildest ideas to lure Murphy into the most elaborate death traps. Would he actually allow Murphy to die if it ever came to that? So far, each time Murphy had come extremely close to losing his life, and each time he had no doubt that Methuselah would have let him die.<br><br>Yet, despite two broken ribs, a fractured wrist, and too many scars to recall, Murphy had so far somehow managed to muster all of his considerable abilities to stay alive long enough to claim his prize.<br><br>And what prizes they had been. Three artifacts Murphy never would have seen in any other way. Each proven with laboratory tests to be genuine, yet Methuselah never uttered a word about his sources. There were lots of issues that plagued Murphy about these mad, whirlwind chases, but each time Murphy went public with the artifacts, no organization, government, or individual collector had come forward to claim they had been stolen.<br><br>So, however and from where Methuselah was getting his occasional treasures, they had proven to be just that.<br><br>Methuselah remained a complete mystery to Murphy. To say he was eccentric would not begin to explain his actions. The man was clearly a scholar of ancient artifacts, yet Murphy could find no trace of where he came from or how he found these artifacts that any archaeologist would drool for. It was especially mystifying why Methuselah did not keep these treasures for himself, or for a museum, or why he chose his really strange games to give Murphy a chance to claim them.<br><br>As a man of high integrity, Murphy believed he could overlook some potential gray areas regarding the source of these artifacts. Some wealthy, connected, but truly mad collector was as close as Murphy could come to an explanation of who Methuselah was. However, there was the troubling religious aspect.<br><br>Methuselah was clearly not a religious man. Quite the opposite. A good deal of the pleasure Methuselah seemed to get from these challenges was to taunt Murphy about his faith. So far, Murphy had been up to every challenge, and he had to admit that in addition to getting the artifacts, part of what drove him was the chance to defy Methuselah&#x2019;s nasty verbal insults about Murphy&#x2019;s faith.<br><br>Which was hardly a justification for his risking his life, Murphy realized. However, pride, temper, stubbornness were all high on the list of Michael Murphy&#x2019;s imperfections. Probably Murphy&#x2019;s greatest reservations about his Methuselah adventures were a result of his deep religious faith, which made it far more difficult to justify the extreme risk to his life and limb.<br><br>Justify the risk not merely to himself, but to his wife, Laura.<br><br>So far, his passion for the quest for artifacts had been a real test of Laura&#x2019;s passion for Murphy. It certainly helped his cause that she held a degree in ancient studies herself. However, there were many arguments after the fact, many pledges that he would try to resist the next Methuselah temptation, but Laura knew there would always be another insanely dangerous Methuselah trap. All he had to do was to dangle another artifact before her husband.<br><br>It was that understanding that caused Murphy to dash off a quick note to Laura before he left for Raleigh that evening. She was at a conference in Atlanta and would not be home for another night, and Murphy wrote down what little he knew about where he was going. He left the note on the mantel in their living room. Just in case.<br>Murphy kept a touch light on the accelerator all the way from Preston to Raleigh to make sure he did not get a speeding ticket. That was one risk he could definitely avoid for the night. The address Methuselah had barked at him was for an eight-story building on an empty street in a deserted neighborhood. When he got to the rooftop, Murphy looked for some sign for a next move.<br><br>Without warning, the very roof beneath his feet opened, and that was when he found himself dropping through the building.<br><br>Free-falling.<br><br>In the fleeting seconds after he started his descent, his multitasking mind flashed on how beautiful Laura had looked yesterday afternoon before she left for her plane, he offered up a quick prayer, and he forced himself to focus on his years of martial arts training, specifically on the best position for his body to be in when he finally landed.<br><br>Assuming he had to land eventually, it would not be pretty.<br><br>He settled on the combination he had come to call Cat&#x2019;s Last Gasp, his own poor interpretation of a Tibetan landing maneuver. He thought of it as the moves a cat in its ninth life would make to land safely. Murphy loosened every muscle, fighting the natural instinct to tense up in anticipation of what was bound to be one fearsome impact.<br><br>Instead, he bounced. In the pitch-black space his body hit what felt like a huge net, and Murphy bounced up and down, rapidly making him more disoriented than the falling had.<br><br>Feelings that were intensified by a blast of bright light that completely blinded Murphy.<br><br>&#x201c;So good of you to drop in, Murphy.&#x201d;<br><br>Methuselah. Though Murphy still could not see, there was no mistaking the cackling laugh that filled the space. Murphy also knew that even if he could see clearly, Methuselah would be well hidden, as he always was.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably still getting your bearings, eh, Murphy, so you can&#x2019;t appreciate what a great old building this is. They built that chute to go through all the floors so they could drop things from the roof down to the main work floor here. I had my people set this up especially for you, but I took pity on you at the last minute and provided the net. I&#x2019;m getting soft. Let&#x2019;s hope you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy finally stopped bouncing and rolled himself to the edge of the net. His sight was beginning to normalize, but there did not seem to be much to see inside this building. There were white walls enclosing one giant floor space. The ceiling, if there was one, must have been several stories high, but the combination of gloomy darkness and now the piercing glow from spotlights mounted on the walls made it impossible to be certain.<br><br>The netting was strung up at one end of the floor space. It was made of thick rope in a crosshatched pattern. The net had been stretched between four heavy wooden poles that were bolted to the floor and stabilized by heavy bags of what Murphy guessed was sand. At the opposite end of the vast room, what looked like a sliding door of shiny silver corrugated metal stood closed.<br><br>Surrounding the floor was a raised work area that was protected by heavy glass. That was where Methuselah must be, Murphy thought, but he could not make out any specific figure up there. His head was clearing and his breathing was starting to normalize.<br><br>&#x201c;That was certainly worth the trip from home, Methuselah. Now, may I claim my prize and get back there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You call that earning your keep, Murphy? That was just my special way to get you inside the tent. Get ready for the real show. Right now.&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time, Murphy heard an ominous sound, a low rumble that filled the empty space, but he was not sure what he was hearing. &#x201c;Aaah, I see, Professor Murphy, by your perked-up ears, that you are ready to meet your match.&#x201d;<br><br>Murphy sighed. So, now it really begins, he thought. Then came a second, much more ominous sound. Something crashed against the metal door from the other side. Something that Murphy suddenly realized was about to come shooting out that metal door, heading directly for him. &#x201c;Say, um, Methuselah, aren&#x2019;t you going to tease me first with a look at your latest artifact? So I at least know what it is that will make you try so hard to kill me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you do know I love to have my sport with you, Murphy. I actually wish you could live to get this one. It&#x2019;s hot stuff. Tell me, what made you so excited about seeing the word &#x2018;Daniel&#x2019; from me today?&#x201d;<br><br>Before Murphy could answer, there was another, even louder banging against the door. Murphy could not help but flinch where he stood and looked anxiously at the rattling metal.<br><br>&#x201c;Up to now you&#x2019;ve put into play some amazing artifacts from Biblical times, Methuselah. I don&#x2019;t know how you got them, but I never would have found them on my own. And Daniel, well, you know he was the most important prophet of all. I have studied him for years. Let me at least get a good close look at whatever Daniel artifact you&#x2019;ve gotten your hands on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Enough talk, Murphy. You&#x2019;re about to get a closer look than you&#x2019;ll want. Because tonight you&#x2019;re not going to study Daniel, you are going to be Daniel.&#x201d;<br><br>With a metallic clang, the sliding door at the other end of the room was raised.</p><h2>Hitchcock Style (Icons)</h2><p>From the motel in Psycho and the bachelor pad in Rear Window to the blonde elegance of Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly, this is the first book about Hitchcock to explore the great director&#39;s style, art direction, and use of fashion.

Equipose</i><br><i>in which I rhythmically transpire.</i><br><br>Written only four years before Rilke's death, this sequence of sonnets, varied in form yet consistently structured, stands as the poet's final masterwork. In these meditations on the constant flux of our world and the ephemerality of experience, Rilke envisions death not only as one among many of life's transformations but also as an ideally receptive state of being. Because Orpheus has visited the realm of death and returned to the living, his lyre, a unifying presence in these poems, is an emblem of fluidity and musical transcendence. And Eurydice, condemned to Hades as a result of Orpheus's backward glance, becomes in Rilke's universe a mythical figure of consolation and hope.<br><br>Edward Snow, in his translations of <i>New Poems</i>, <i>The Book of Images</i>, <i>Uncollected Poems</i>, and <i>Duino Elegies</i>, has emerged as Rilke's most able English-language interpreter.

By the illustrator of A Child&#39;s Garden of Verses. Reprint.</p><p>Clement C. Moore's beloved poem about Santa's arrival on Christmas Eve has been illustrated by hundreds of artists since its first publication in 1823. Two collectors of antique children's books have selected a variety of these charming pictures from Arthur Rackham, Jessie Willcox Smith, Thomas Nast, and other renowned children's illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the images are from versions of the poem; a few are from antique postcards or magazines. Source notes for all the illustrations are included. Santa is dressed differently by each artist, but he is always "chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf" who brings joy to all good little girls and boys. This attractive edition of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> will be enjoyed most by collectors of children's books or lovers of things Victorian. Youngsters who are already familiar with the poem will delight in comparing the different old-fashioned Santas and the children of long ago "nestled all snug in their beds." A charming holiday gift to leave under the tree on Christmas Eve for anyone who believes in the magic of Santa Claus. (Ages 5 to adult) <i>--Marcie Bovetz</i>A smiling Santa in goggles and aviator helmet speeds up the Christmas Eve delivery system with updated transportation from his &#34;Far Northair&#34; sleigh. This futuristic-looking vehicle still uses eight reindeer, but additional propulsion is controlled through sophisticated equipment in the covered cockpit (including a built-in beverage maker with choices from hot chocolate to borsht). This interpretation of Moore&#39;s classic poem finds Santa making a delivery to a household with three children in a traditional, suburban neighborhood. The father of the family springs out of bed in a panic in one dramatic spread, with his hand seeming to stretch right off the page toward the reader. A diverse crew of helpers joins Santa on his Christmas Eve flight, with costumed elves from many countries and ethnic groups helping to unload the toys and clean the soot off Santa&#39;s red cape, furry pants and pointed boots. Elves and toys decorate the endpapers and also appear as spot illustrations at the end of the poem&#39;s verses, which are attractively framed with bold, red borders on alternating spreads. An &#34;interview&#34; of St. Nick by illustrator Watson concludes the volume.

With each new volume of the Corean Chronicles we learn more about the magical underpinnings of this fascinating realm as we follow the continuing adventures of his reluctant hero, Alucius. In <i>Legacies </i>he became the first Iron Valley militiaman to escape sorcerous enslavement in Madrien. In <i>Darknesses</i>, he found a way to defeat a would-be conqueror who revived the fearsome creatures and potent weaponry of the legendary past. Now he returns to face the greatest challenges yet to both his courage and his magical Talent.<br><br>Alucius is happy back on his nightsheep stead with his beloved wife Wendra, who is expecting their first child. But the country is beset by enemies on all sides. Although the Lord Protector of Lanachrona keeps his promise not to order Alucius back to active duty, Alucius finds his request for help no easier to ignore. <br><br>Newly promoted to higher rank, and given command of a combined force of the Northern and Southern Guards, Alucius must first quell a strange religiously-inspired rebellion and then find a way to destroy the powerful weapons of ancient design again being used by the forces of Madrien. Unlike the Lord Protector, Alucius can see that a third, covert, threat must be behind the other two. He will have to confront an alien evil that seeks to enslave the whole world of Corus in the guise of bringing back a lost golden age. Only the timely assistance of the mysterious ancient Soarers and the addition of Wendra's Talent to his own give him any hope of success. <i>Scepters </i>is a stirring climax to the first Corean trilogy.<br></p><p>L.E. Modesitt, Jr. lives in Cedar City, Utah.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Hyalt, Lanachrona</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Light fell upon the priest. That single ray of illumination, shaped by the ancient master-carved lens in the ceiling of the long and narrow chapel hewn out of the red rock cliffs, bathed the celebrant. His green tunic and trousers, trimmed in purple, shimmered. So did the alabaster makeup that covered his face. The blue-silver threads in the black short-haired wig picked up the light, creating a halo around his face. The black boots, with inset lifts, reflected light as if they too were burnished mirrors.<br>A long chord echoed through the temple, but the priest did not speak until all was silent.<br>"When our forebears turned their backs on the True Duarchy, then the One Who Is turned away and let the Cataclysm fall upon Corus..." The celebrant's voice seemed to come from everywhere, yet nowhere.<br>More than a hundred worshippers stood with bowed heads, heads covered with black scarves of mourning. Only a handful dared to look from lowered heads toward the front of the temple.<br>"The Cataclysm did not have to happen. The misery and suffering did not have to come to pass. And why did it come to be? How could so many be so blind?"<br>The only response to his questions was silence.<br>"The Duarchy of Corus bestowed peace and prosperity upon all the world, for generation upon generation. Never was there so fair a realm, so just a world. Never were so blessed the peoples of a world. Never had so many benefited so much. And then, in an instant, it all vanished..."<br>In the next-to-last line of worshippers stood a dark-haired figure in gray. He was a head taller than those around him, and his face paler. The weave of the wool of his traveling cloak was somewhat finer. His head was bent slightly less than the heads of others, and his eyes never left the celebrant. The faintest hint of an amused smile appeared from time to time at the corners of his thin lips.<br>"...as the Mantra of Mourning declares...Ice flowed from the skies. The air that had been so fair, and perfumed, became as thin and as acrid as vinegar. Streams dried in their beds, rivers in their courses, never to flow again...All that had been beautiful and great perished and was lost. And for what reason?"<br>After a momentary silence, the priest answered, "Because people were selfish and thought only of themselves. They turned their backs on the True Duarchy, and when they did so, they turned their backs on the One Who Is...for the Duarchy was indeed His creation...<br>"...in this world of transitory glory, when warlord succeeds warlord, and battle follows battle, and evil follows evil, we must persevere. We must have faith in the One Who Is. We must follow the path of righteousness to restore the old truths. For only by the instrument of the True Duarchy shall we be redeemed. Only by restoring the true creation of the One Who Is shall we once more see peace and prosperity, faith and faithfulness..."<br>The traveler in gray nodded, appreciatively, and continued to listen.<br>"...even today, the troubles continue. The hills to the north and west have become so dry in your lifetimes that they support nothing but twisted trees and spiky thorn, and yet the unbelievers do not see. Even here in Hyalt, where it is obvious, they do not see...<br>"...when the only deity is gold, when the only rule is power, when the only law is that laid down by the longest blade, by the deadliest rifle, no man can be safe, and none can find security. There are no arts, no fine buildings, no wondrous words, nothing but gold and blood..."<br>The traveler continued to listen, until at last came a hymn and the concluding refrain:<br>* * *<br>"...for the beauty of the skies and sea,<br>the full return of perfect harmony,<br>the blessings of the True Duarchy<br>and for the One Who Will Always Be!"<br>* * *<br>After the hymn, the priest turned to the worshippers. "Praise to the One Who Is! And for His creation of the Duarchy!"<br>"And for His creation of the Duarchy!" repeated the congregation.<br>"Praise to the One Who Is! For He will come again in glory!"<br>"For He will come again in glory!"<br>"Praise to Him and His True Duarchy! For all that was and will be!"<br>"For all that was and will be!"<br>The single ray of light vanished, plunging the cavern temple into total darkness for a long moment. Then, slowly, more indirect light filtered into the temple as the skylight portals, with their gauze-covered panes, were uncovered.<br>The sanctuary at the front of the temple was empty.<br>The gray-clad traveler made his way forward, toward the side entrance leading to the chambers of the celebrant. His fingers touched briefly the outer garments over the heavy leather wallet hidden beneath his cloak and filled with golds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright �2004 by L. E.

After he wins the festival wrestling championship, he and Ehwa begin to meet, sneaking spare moments to be together.

Now in her teens, Ehwa falls in love with a laborer who at first pays her unwanted romantic attention. Meanwhile, Ehwa&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s own love life continues to be one as much of longing as of satisfaction. Excellent storytelling and beautiful artwork make this worthy of the included reading-group discussion guide. Recommended for all graphic-novel collections, this is essential for those that already have the first volume. &#x2014; Francisca Goldsmith</p><p><strong>Review in 12/1 VOYA</strong></p><p>In this second installment of the Color Trilogy, teenaged Ehwa learns more about the thrills and the pains of love when she falls for Duksam, a brash and handsome young wrestler. Ehwa lives alone with her young widowed mother, Namwon, in a rural Korean village in the late nineteenth century. As Ehwa pines for Duksam and longs for their secret meetings, her mother waits for visits from her lover, a traveling salesman. Ehwa and Namwon&#x2019;s bond is the core of the book, as they navigate their changing mother/daughter relationship. Although Namwon does not know of Ehwa&#x2019;s feelings for Duksam, she realizes that Ehwa will soon be ready to marry and considers what her life will be like when Ehwa is gone. Ehwa and Duksam&#x2019;s dreams are threatened when Duksam&#x2019;s elderly master, Cho, finds out about Ehwa. Obsessed with Ehwa&#x2019;s youth and beauty, Master Cho is determined to marry Ehwa himself.</p><p>Like the first book of this manhwa trilogy, this sequel should appeal to any reader looking for a poetic coming-of-age story or adventurous manga fans. Ehwa&#x2019;s physical and emotional growth is evocatively compared to her natural surroundings. Hwa&#x2019;s expressive artwork and lyrical writing sensitively yet realistically explore romance and sexuality, including Ehwa&#x2019;s first kiss and her first masturbation experience. Humor also pervades the story, especially when Ehwa learns about sex from her more experienced friend Bongsoon.&#x2014;Amy Luedtke.</p><p><strong>Review in 9/1 SLJ</strong></p><p>Gr 10 Up&#x2013;In this installment in the trilogy set in 19th-century Korea, Ehwa falls in love with a strong young man named Duksam, while her mother continues her affair with a traveling salesman. This is a quiet and intimate story about a girl&#x2019;s first sexual awakenings as well as the changing nature of her relationship with her mother during her adolescence. The language and concepts are poetic&#x2013;Ehwa&#x2019;s mother teaches her that women are like flowers while men are like fire and wind. While Hwa&#x2019;s artwork predominantly conveys a lot of emotion with very few carefully placed lines, there are some larger scenes of natural beauty (flowers, trees, the night sky) that are breathtaking in their detail. A Korean village is a far cry from the environment of most American teens, but the romantic themes will keep even modern girls pining for more of this story. It is not necessary to have read <em>The Color of Earth</em> (Roaring Brook, 2009) to understand this volume, but since readers will probably be curious to learn about Ehwa&#x2019;s first two loves and about what will happen with Duksam in the future, ordering the trilogy is a sound investment.&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</p><p><strong>Review in 10/1 BCCB</strong></p><p>This sequel to The Color of Earth presents what Hwa calls &#x201c;little gems from my mother&#x2019;s life at sixteen,&#x201d; that is, further adventures in love and growing up for Ehwa, the girl of early twentieth-century Korea. She meets a fascinating new boy, experiences her first kiss, fights with her best friend, learns how to pleasure herself, reflects further on her mother&#x2019;s relationship with her traveling salesman, and avoids being sold into marriage with an elderly man. As she grows and develops, she experiences her first conflicts wit her mother as she tries to keep secrets, at the same time learning as much as she can from her mother&#x2019;s wisdom and life experience. Ehwa continues to be an appealing protagonist, and the book&#x2019;s candor about her growth gives her experiences immediacy. The &#x201c;little gems&#x201d; approach compromises the narrative flow somewhat, though, and creates a sometimes tedious repetition of themes, and Ehwa&#x2019;s obsession with finding and understanding love to the exclusion of any other aspect of daily life becomes attenuated and overwrought. The art maintains the delicate, luminous quality of the first book, but greater emphasis on quarreling, insecure girls and Ehwa&#x2019;s various expressions of angst renders the visuals a tad monotonous at times. The final segment set up the conclusion, however, making this a necessary installment to the trilogy. Appended is a useful reading group guide that focuses on general techniques for reading graphic novels as well as specific questions covering material from the first two books.</p></p><h2>Better Homes and Gardens Calorie-Smart Meals: 150 Recipes for Delicious 300-, 400-, and 500-Calorie Dishes (Better Homes and Gardens Cooking)</h2><p><b>The perfect companion for cooking delicious and varied meals that fit into a healthy eating plan</b><br><br><i>Better Homes and Gardens Calorie-Smart Meals</i> is a must-have recipe collection of tasty meals that don&#x2019;t break the daily calorie bank.

Eyewitness accounts, data collected by the authors, and the published reports of naturalists establish the astonishing extent to which living monkeys, lemurs, apes, and even humans fall victim to a wide variety of predators, some of which even specialize in the consumption of primates. Additionally, the fossil record demonstrates that primates have been prey for millions of years, a fact that necessarily shaped the evolution of our earliest ancestors in body and behavior. Skillfully combining information from a number of lines of evidence, <i>Man the Hunted</i> casts an entirely new light on the natural history of primates and the evolution of fossil and modern humans.</p><p><b>Donna L. Hart</b> has been a longtime professional in wildlife conservation and currently teaches in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Missouri&#x2013;St. Louis. <b>Robert W. Sussman</b>, Washington University (St. Louis), is recent editor of <i>American Anthropologist</i> and has served in editorial capacities with numerous other journals in anthropology and primatology.Contrary to the familiar image of the aggressive, spear-wielding "caveman," our hominid ancestors were more hunted than hunters, more preyed upon than slayers of large predators, contend wildlife conservationist Hart and anthropologist Sussman. The authors note that as anthropologists and primatologists have studied various primate species in the African and Asian rainforests, many myths have been dispelled about how aggressive these primates (who resemble our ancestors) were and how they reacted to predation. And as more early hominid fossils have been discovered, researchers have come to realize that they were small enough to make a tasty snack for a pack of large hyenas. One skull bears twin holes that match exactly the fangs of a leopard; another displays scratches that suggest the victim was carried off by a very large bird of prey. Modern-day humans are still preyed upon in many places: mountain lions have ambushed joggers in California, and in southern Africa, the crowned harp-eagle occasionally carries off a small child. The authors maintain that our need to socialize stems from early hominids' improved odds of survival when they banded together against predators. Some readers may raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that our predilection for a beautiful scenic view evolved from our ancestors' scanning the African grasslands for danger, but the authors' novel proposals merit serious consideration.

Her fianc, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher, of Scotland Yard, is to meet her there on the upcoming weekend. Meanwhile, her aunt and uncles daughter Patricia is in love with Rollo Frieth, captain of Oxford's Ambrose College team, most of which is staying at the Cheringham house. It's soon apparent to Daisy that team spirit is being eroded by the arrogant verbal attacks directed by nasty Basil DeLancy at coxswain Horace Bott, whose only sin is that he's middle class and from the Midlands. When DeLancy falls overboard and dies, in a qualifying race, Alec finds himself confronting a case of murder instead of the peaceful weekend he and Daisy had envisioned. Awash in dull characters, wordy interviews, silly encounters, and unconvincing motives: only the riverside scene is worth time spent here.

He is less well known as a superb photographer of the female nude. His most important pictures in this genre were made in 1949-50 during intense sessions with artist's models that were essentially an artistic antidote to the ephemeral fashion world. Charged with powerful, physical, and sexual energy, yet somehow chaste, the images are among the most ambitious and successful nudes ever made. Sequenced to reveal the artist's progressive exploration of his theme, the photographs constitute a remarkable whole -- a frieze of life based on a love affair with earthly goddesses.<br>-- The great 1949-50 nudes by Irving Penn have scarcely been seen and have never been the subject of serious book-length study.<br>-- The book features faithful tritone reproductions of Penn's exquisitely wrought prints in silver and platinum and four dramatic gatefolds.<br>--</p><p>Irving Penn's books include Moments Preserved (1960), Worlds in a Small Room (1974), Inventive Paris Clothes 1909-1939 (1977), Flowers (1980), Passage (1991), and Still Life (2001).

A. Salvatore, best known for his immensely popular Forgotten Realms novels.<i> In Servant of the Shard</i>, Salvatore focuses on two of his greatest villains.<br><br>Having seized the Crystal Shard at the end of <i>The Silent Blade</i>, the dark elf Jarlaxle now struggles to control it. Grudgingly aided by the assassin Artemis Entreri, they must desperately look elsewhere for help before the gem destroys them and all that they worked for.<br><br>The Assassin<br><br>Surrounded by dark elves, Artemis Entreri tightens his grip on the streets of Calimport. While he urges caution, his black-skinned sponsor grows ever more ambitious. The assassin will soon find himself on a path his most hated enemy has walked before him--a path that leads to a place where someone like Entreri would never be welcome.<br><br>The Drow<br><br>Jarlaxle has ascended from dark Menzoberranzan with only evil intentions. The malevolent Crystal Shard&#x2019;s influence on him intensifies until even the drow agents he brought with him grow fearful. When Bregan D&#x2019;aerthe itself begins to turn on him, Jarlaxle will be forced to find a savior in the man he&#x2019;s come to enslave.<br></p><p>Think of it as <i>Drowfellas</i>. Backstabbing and internecine intrigue abound as the ambitious members of a shady organization (in this case, the dark-elf mercenary band Bregan D'aerthe) vie for power, struggle to fend off reprisals, and generally cause all sorts of trouble. Themes of redemption and moral metamorphosis keep the plot moving, accompanied by intermittent bursts of spectacular, cinematic violence.<p> <i>The Servant of the Shard</i>, the immediate follow-up to <i>The Spine of the World</i> and <i>The Silent Blade</i>, is the long-awaited exposition on the history of Artemis Entreri. But perhaps more importantly, <i>Servant of the Shard</i> brings us the brilliant, bang-up pairing of master assassin Entreri and Bregan D'aerthe godfather Jarlaxle, filling out a deadly triangle with the bloodthirsty artifact Crenshinibon. (The rest--more magic items, tons of cool spells and psionics thanks to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel Oblodra, cameos from <i>The Cleric Quintet</i>, and a blow-out finale with an ancient red dragon--well, that's all just icing on the cake.)</p><p> The big question, which hopefully won't have to be asked again after this title: Can Bob Salvatore really pull off another Drizzt Do'Urden book without Drizzt? Without a doubt. Anybody who wasn't won over by the Wulfgar-centric <i>Spine of the World</i> should come away more than satisfied with <i>The Servant of the Shard</i>. Grumbling and hammer-hurling (courtesy of Wulfgar) might not be your thing, but Drizzt does have an equal in Entreri when it comes to perplexed introspection and predictably dazzling swordplay. If nothing else, Salvatore is merely collecting on investments he's made in his previous 17 Forgotten Realms novels--after laying such a strong foundation with solid plots and characterizations, it should come as no surprise that we're instantly sucked into a story that brings a couple of formerly supporting characters to front stage center. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>R.A.

Jonathan Darrow is an Anglican priest when he receives a shattering vision and knows he must leave the monastery that has been his home for seventeen years. As he plunges into the temptations of the real world, a crisis sends him into the labyrinth of his past to pluck out the buried truth beneath the deceptions he has been living through.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Susan Howatch</b> was born in Surrey. After getting a degree in law, she emigrated to America, where she married, had a daughter, and embarked on a career as a writer. When she eventually left the United States, she lived in the Republic of Ireland for four years before returning to England. She spent time in Salisbury&#x2014;which was the inspiration for her Starbridge sequence of novels&#x2014;and now lives in London.Jon Darrow is the Anglican priest and abbot with a charismatic presence and psychic abilities who figured in a small but memorable way in Howatch's Glittering Images , to which this is a sequel. Darrow's "glamorous powers" are both a blessing and a curse: he is subject to intense visions which may come directly from Godor from the Devil. Set during the early years of WW II, and told in the first person, the narrative appropriately holds the reader spellbound by the hints and gradual revelation of Darrow's character. The novel opens with a vision that Darrow interprets as God's instruction to leave his religious order and return to serve Him in the world. But he is forced to work with his superior, an old enemy, to ascertain whether this was indeed a true vision from God, and he finds himself revealing more and more of his life and motivations. When he does leave, the strain of the upheaval and the subsequent events provoke an intense spiritual crisis and breakdown; but this signals the collapse of the spiritually arrogant, intellectually superior persona that Jon Darrow had created to protect himself from the pain of being. In this witty, wise novel, the question, "Does God exist?" is always understood and, true to life, ambiguously answered. Howatch assures her readers that a third novel, about a peripheral but minor character here, is on its way. 75,000 first printing; BOMC alternate . <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mystery of the Witches&#39; Bridge</h2><p>Dan tries to dispel the curse supposedly placed by his Puritan ancestor on the town of York, Massachusetts</p><p></p><h2>Jewelry Making: Tips and Tricks of the Trade</h2><p>Making jewelry at a professional level has never been so simple with this new guide.

Consisting of The Great Fortune (1960), The Spoilt City (1962), and Friends and Heroes (1965), the trilogy is a semiautobiographical account of a British couple living in the Balkans during World War II. The complex narrative, composed of several different voices, is noted for its vivid historicity. In The Great Fortune, newlyweds Guy and Harriet Pringle encounter an increasingly fascist environment in Bucharest, Romania, in 1939. Guy is a gregarious university lecturer whose liberal views contrast with those of his reserved wife. Clarence Lawson is a colleague of Guy who worships him and finds Harriet attractive. In The Spoilt City, Harriet faces marital problems and befriends Sasha Drucker, a Romanian army deserter, and Prince Yakimov, a Russian emigre. Just before the arrival of German troops in Bucharest, Guy sends Harriet to Greece, where they are reunited in Friends and Heroes. Guy acquires a teaching post and becomes involved in communist politics. By the end of the novel, the Pringles repair their marriage and flee to Cairo, where their story is continued in The Levant Trilogy. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Cross Country (Alex Cross, 14)</h2><p>When the home of Alex Cross's longtime friend, Ellie Cox, is turned into the worst murder scene Alex has ever seen, he is devastated.

As Alex and his girlfriend Brianna Stone begin the hunt for the villain responsible for the killings, they quickly find themselves entangeled in the deadly Nigerian underworld of Washington D.C.. What they discover is shocking: a strongly organized gang of teenage thugs headed by a powerful, diabolical man-The Tiger.<br> As the killing spree escalates, Alex and Brianna realize they are not dealing with any ordinary killer, but one who has brought his personal war of vengeance to America's capital. But just when the detectives think they're closing in on the elusive murderer, the Tiger disappears into thin air. Unable to let the killer get away with this narrow escape, Alex makes it his duty to bring the brutal butcher to justice. He knows that he must follow The Tiger. Alone. <br> When Alex arrives in Nigeria, he discovers a world where justice is as foreign as he is. Unprotected and alone in a strange country, bombarded on all sides by the murderous threats of The Tiger, Alex must draw on his fiercest instincts just to survive in a lawless world. <br> From the author <i>Time</i> magazine has called "the man who can't miss," <i>Cross Country</i> is the most breathtaking, heart-stopping, electrifing Alex Cross thriller yet.</p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>.

His frustration is expressed perfectly by narrator Peter Fernandez. Fernandez is ably assisted by Dion Graham, who fills in some of the story left out of the abridgment. Fernandez so powerfully tells the story of Cross&#39;s efforts to capture an international killer called &#34;The Tiger&#34; that the listener&#39;s fists knot with the tension as Cross&#39;s fortunes go from bad to worse. The bloody trail that leads to the ending makes Cross&#39;s ultimate success the kind he cannot afford to repeat.

The residents are trapped inside leading to drama, hysteria, and a shocking series of events.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan Reviews <em>Under the Dome</em></strong><br><br> <b>Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan share their enthusiasm for Stephen King's thriller, <i>Under the Dome</i>. This pair of reviewers knows a thing or two about the art of crafting a great thriller. Del Toro is the Oscar-nominated director of international blockbuster films, including <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> and <em>Hellboy</em>. Hogan is the author of several acclaimed novels, including <em>The Standoff</em> and <em>Prince of Thieves</em>, which won the International Association of Crime Writer's Dashiell Hammett Award in 2005. The two recently collaborated to write the bestselling horror novel, <em>The Strain</em>, the first of a proposed trilogy. Read their exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Under the Dome</i>:</b><br><br> The first thing readers might find scary about Stephen King's <i>Under The Dome</i> is its length. The second is the elaborate town map and list of characters at the front of the book (including "Dogs of Note"), which sometimes portends, you know, heavy lifting. Don't you believe it. Breathless pacing and effortless characterization are the hallmarks of King's best books, and here the writing is immersive, the suspense unrelenting. The pages turn so fast that your hand--or Kindle-clicking thumb--will barely be able to keep up. <p></p> <p> <i>You Are Here.</i> </p> <p> Nobody yarns a &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; like Stephen King. Nobody. The implausibility of a dome sealing off an entire city--a motif seen before in pulp magazines and on comic book covers--is given the most elaborate real-life alibi by crafting details, observations, and insights that make us nod silently while we read. Promotional materials reference <em>The Stand</em> in comparison, but we liken <i>Under The Dome</i> more to King's excellent novella, <em>The Mist</em>: another locked-door situation on an epic scale, a tour-de-force in which external stressors bake off the civility of a small town full of dark secrets, exposing souls both very good...and very, very bad.</p> <p> Yes, "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street," but there is so much more this time. The expansion of King&#x2019;s diorama does not simply take a one-street fable and turn it into a town, but finds new life for old archetypes, making them morally complex and attuned to our world today. It makes them relevant and affecting once again. And the beauty of it all is that the final lesson, the great insight that is gained at the end of this draining journey, is not a righteous 1950&#x2019;s sermon but an incredibly moving and simple truth. A nugget of wisdom you'll be using as soon as you turn the last page. </p> <p> <i>This Is Now.</i> </p> <p> Along the way, you get bravura writing, especially featuring the town kids, and a delicious death aria involving one of the most nefarious characters--who dies alone, but not really--as well as a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a cameo (of sorts) by none other than Jack Reacher. Indeed--whether during a much-needed comfort break, or a therapeutic hand-flexing--you may find yourself wondering, "Is this a horror novel? Or is it a thriller?" The answer, of course, is: Yes, yes, yes. </p> <p> <i>"...the blood hits the wall like it always hits the wall."</i> </p> <p> It seems impossible that, as he enters his sixth decade of publishing, the dean of dark fiction could add to his vast readership. But that is precisely what will happen...when the Dome drops.</p><p> <i>Now Go Read It. --Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan</i></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p> <p><strong>The Story Behind the Cover</strong><br>Click on image to enlarge </p><p> </p><p> The jacket concept for <i>Under the Dome</i> originated as an ambitious idea from the mind of Stephen King. The artwork is a combination of photographs, illustration and 3-D rendering. This is a departure from the direction of King's most recent illustrated covers. <br><br> In order to achieve the arresting image for this jacket, Scribner art director Rex Bonomelli had to seek out artists who could do a convincing job of creating a realistic portrayal of the town of Chester's Mill, the setting of the novel. Bonomelli found the perfect team of digital artists, based in South America and New York, whose cutting edge work had previously been devoted to advertisement campaigns. This was their first book jacket and an exciting venture for them. "They are used to working with the demands of corporate clients," says Bonomelli. "We gave them freedom and are thrilled with what they came up with." <br><br> The CGI (computer generated imagery) enhanced image looks more like something made for the big screen than for the page and is sure to make a lasting impact on King fans. <br></p><p></p> <p><strong>Meet the Characters</strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b>Dale Barbara</b><br>Barbie, a drifter, ex-army, walks with a burden of guilt from the time he spent in Iraq.

For the attending authorities, it was an open and shut case of suicide. What no one knew then, however, and which is only being revealed here for the very first time, is that the person found dead that day -- Kurt Cobain, the superstar frontman of Nirvana -- was murdered.</p><p>In early April 1994, Cobain went missing for days, or so it seemed; in fact, some people knew where he was, and one of them was Courtney Love. Now a star in Hollywood and rock music, in early 1994 she was preparing to release her major label debut with her band, Hole, and what she knew then, though few others did, was that Cobain was planning to divorce her. "Love &amp; Death" painsts a critical portrait of Courtney Love; it also reveals for the first time the case tapes made by Love's own P . I., Tom Grant, a man on a mission to find the truth about Kurt Cobain's demise; and introduces us to a number of characters who feature in various theories about plots to kill Cobain. In addition, Cobain's grandfather goes public, charging that his grandson was murdered. Drawing on new forensic evidence and police reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the book explodes the myths that have long convinced the world that Cobain took his own life, and reveals that the official scenario was scientifically impossible. </p><p>Against a background of at least sixty-eight copycat suicides since 1994, award-winning investigative journalists Max Wallace and Ian Halperin have conducted a ten-year crusade for the truth, and in "Love &amp; Death" they are finally able to present a chilling and convincing case that eachand every one of these suicides was preventable -- and in doing so, they call for this case to be reopened and properly investigated.</p><b>Max Wallace</b> is a recipient of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine�s Award for Investigative Journalism; he is also a documentary filmmaker.

With clear and specific methods and advice, David Allen&#39;s tried and trusted formula for business efficiency could transform the way you operate and your experience of work.</p><p>With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, "flow," "mind like water," and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called <i>Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance</i>.<p> Not quite. Yes, <i>Getting Things Done</i> offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible <i>Fast Company</i> has dubbed "the personal productivity guru," suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)</p><p> As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket" </p><p> That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p>David Allen has had more than twenty years' experience as a management consultant, executive coach, and educator and is the president of David Allen &amp; Co.

Milton once said that Walter Van Tilburg Clark "did perhaps more than anyone else to define (in his fiction) the mode of perception, the acquisition of knowledge, and the style which we tend to call Western." In 1950, Walter Van Tilburg Clark, author of the acclaimed novel&nbsp;<i>The Ox-Bow Incident</i>, published a collection of short stories that had already won distinction in various national magazines. The collection was well received by reviewers, and subsequent critics have noted that these stories reflect both Clark&#x2019;s literary power and the major concerns of his novels: the interior and intuitive complexities of good and evil, and the fragile, intricate web that connects humankind to the rest of the natural world.</p><p>A foreword by Ann Ronald, one of the West&#x2019;s most astute literary critics, sets the stories into the context of Clark&#x2019;s oeuvre and illuminates the way they reveal crucial characteristics of this writer&#x2019;s imagination.</p></p><p>Walter Van Tilburg Clark, author of&nbsp;<i>The Ox-box Incident&nbsp;</i>,&nbsp;<i>The City of Trembling Leaves</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Watchful Gods and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<i>The Track of the Cat</i>, lived in Virginia City and is considered one of Nevada's most distinguished novelists. Born in 1909, he ranks as one of Nevada's most distinguished literary figures in the twentieth century, as well as a leading interpreter of the American West. Clark died in Virginia City, Nevada, in 1971.&#x201c;Clark appears in this collection of his short stories as a sensitive and cultivated writer, as much at home with the knowledgeable outdoor men and their natural world as with intellectuals and academicians....

Adlerian psychology focuses on the central idea that every human being has a basic need to feel powerful-with children being no exception to the rule. And when this need isn't met in positive ways, kids will resort to negative methods, which often result in some of the most frustrating behavior they exhibit. <i>If I Have to Tell You One More Time...</i> provides the knowledge and tools parents need to address the deeper issues that inspire their children to misbehave.

Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Rick&#39;s first novel featuring the heroic young demi-god, was the overall winner of the Red House Children&#39;s Book Award in 2006.Speedy introductions of familiar and new characters and previous plot summaries may briefly confuse a new listener, but fans will savor them. It&#39;s not long before Percy Jackson, half-god son of Poseidon and a mortal mom, learns of his fourth mission: searching the Labyrinth for a way to stop Kronos&#39;s plan to unite the evil forces of the underworld. Jesse Bernstein is on target whether he&#39;s narrating blow-by-blow accounts of Percy&#39;s sword fights or inventing cameos for various other characters: Hephaestus, who repairs a Toyota; an aged Daedalus; and Grover, Percy&#39;s slow-witted sidekick. Bernstein is just as skillful at wringing humor from the witty dialogue and from the contrasts between the modern and ancient worlds. In Percy&#39;s world a half-god can summon the dead with McDonald&#39;s Happy Meals.

One of the most powerful photographs depicts Joanne Thornton Wilson and her niece, Shirley Anne Kirksey, standing in front of a theater in Mobile, Alabama, an image which became a forceful "weapon of choice," as Parks would say, in the struggle against racism and segregation. While 26 photographs were eventually published in <i>Life</i> and some were exhibited in his lifetime, the bulk of Parks' assignment was thought to be lost. In 2011, five years after Parks' death, The Gordon Parks Foundation discovered more than 70 color transparencies at the bottom of an old storage bin marked "Segregation Series" that are now published for the first time in <i>Segregation Story</i>.</p><p>After nearly six decades much of the anger in America has dissipated and many wrongs have been righted, but the truth that Parks captured with his camera, his chronicle of suffering and redemption, of courage in the face of appalling injustice, still possesses an unsettling power. (The Editors <i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>Gordon Parks courageous photography helped awaken America at the dawn of the civil rights era. He was a master of portraying people from every walk of life. (The Editors <i>CBS</i>)<br><br>The portraits are classic Parks; they are sympathetic but not simpering, and aim to emphasize the subjects&#x2019; humanity rather than shallowly flatter. (Lilly Lampe <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Gordon Parks was born into poverty and segregation in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 1912. An itinerant labourer, he worked as a brothel pianist and railcar porter, among other jobs, before buying a camera at a pawnshop and teaching himself photography. In 1956, Life magazine published his photo-essay The Restraints: Open and Hidden, which revealed the day to day existence of African American families living in the rural South under Jim Crow segregation. The piece sought to show the magazine&#x2019;s (largely white) audience that black people, even those living under segregation, lived full, rich and ordinary lives. For many years, the full series was thought lost, but in 2011, more than 70 colour transparencies were resdiscovered. Many of these beautiful images have been republished by Steidl, in the book Segregation Story. (The Editors <i>The Telegraph</i>)<br><br>Along with the half-dozen spreads (containing twenty-six images) of the published article, Segregation Story includes sixty photographs Parks made while working on the project. In many ways, they are even more powerful without any text, for words are like a small cup dipped into the deep well of these images, which are so rich in information&#x2013;and, at times, in mystery. Social issues are only part of the story. Parks had a particular genius for portraying the imaginative worlds of childhood&#x2013;an image of two boys in overalls fishing, our view of them framed by moss-choked branches, is a masterpiece in itself. (Barry Schwabsky <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>Rare and striking images of everyday life in the Jim Crow South. (The Editors <i>Garden &amp; Gun</i>)<br><br>The rare transparencies had been rediscovered that year by Peter W. Kunhardt Jr., the executive director of the Gordon Parks Foundation, who found them in an unopened cardboard box in their archives. Although the photo was essentially unknown before then, it recently gained prominence when a cropped version of the image graced the cover of the book &#x201c;Gordon Parks: Segregation Story,&#x201d; which was published by Steidl as the catalog for the High Museum&#x2019;s current show of the same name in Atlanta. (James Estrin <i>The New York Times - Lens</i>)<br><br>What&#x2019;s most interesting, then, is how little overt racial strife is depicted in the resulting pictures in Gordon Parks: Segregation Story, at the High Museum through June 7, 2015, and how much more complicated they are than straightforward reportage on segregation. Sure, there&#x2019;s some conventional reporting; several pictures hinge on &#x201c;whites/blacks only&#x201d; signs, for example. But most of the pictures are studies of individuals, carefully composed and shot in lush color. (Anderson Scott <i>artsatl.com</i>)<br><br>Parks, raised in a poor tebnant-farming family, became one of the most celebrated photographers of his generation, not only because of his images, which often held a harsh mirror up to American racism, but also because of his writings &#x2015; his memoirs and the semi-autobiographical novel "The Learning Tree" &#x2015; and his 1971 action movie, "Shaft," which helped open new avenues for black actors and directors.

It infected a third of the people on Earth--from the poorest immigrants of New York City to the king of Spain, Franz Kafka, Mahatma Gandhi and Woodrow Wilson. But despite a death toll of between 50 and 100 million people, it exists in our memory as an afterthought to World War I.<br>In this gripping narrative history, Laura Spinney traces the overlooked pandemic to reveal how the virus travelled across the globe, exposing mankind's vulnerability and putting our ingenuity to the test. As socially significant as both world wars, the Spanish flu dramatically disrupted--and often permanently altered--global politics, race relations and family structures, while spurring innovation in medicine, religion and the arts. It was partly responsible, Spinney argues, for pushing India to independence, South Africa to apartheid and Switzerland to the brink of civil war. It also created the true "lost generation." Drawing on the latest research in history, virology, epidemiology, psychology and economics, <i>Pale Rider</i> masterfully recounts the little-known catastrophe that forever changed humanity.</p><p><strong>Laura Spinney </strong>is a science journalist and a literary novelist. She has published two novels in English, and her writing on science has appeared in<em> National Geographic</em>, <em>Nature</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, and <em>The Telegraph</em>, among others. Her oral history portrait of a European city, <em>Rue Centrale</em>, was published in 2013 in French and English."Impressive...Set against the devastating backdrop of global contagion, it is individual lives and deaths, discovered in letters, diaries, biographies and memoirs, that epitomize this rich account. Spinney invokes potent images...Along with exemplary research, Spinney's narrative is packed with fascinating, quirky detail...As the centenary of this monumental event approaches, other volumes on the pandemic will undoubtedly appear. <i>Pale Rider</i> sets the bar very high."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>Nature</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"A saga of tragedies and a detective story... <i>Pale Rider</i> is not just an excavation but a reimagining of the past. As the book progresses, the flu is cast increasingly as a character that crops up Zelig-like at important moments in history, altering the course of events previously unattributed to it.... Compelling."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The Guardian</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A book about the Spanish flu could so easily be dreary-complex pathology interwoven with pervasive tragedy. Not so <i>Pale Rider</i>. I've seldom had so much fun reading about people dying. Laura Spinney, a science journalist, is adept at explaining arcane scientific research in an entertaining, comprehensible way. ...With superb investigative skill and a delightfully light-hearted writing style, Spinney extends her analysis far beyond the relatively short duration of the plague....Spinney finds it odd that we know so little about the worst calamity to affect the human race. So do I. There are tens of thousands of books about the First World War, yet that flu is, arguable, more relevant to our world. While global war is, we hope, a thing of the past, global pestilence hovers like a vulture."&#x2015;<b><i><em><strong>The Times</strong></em></i></b><br><br>"Wide-sweeping... Spinney is a storyteller with a science writer's cabinet of facts. Retracing influenza's death trail over nine continents, she attempts to show how the flu affected not only the war-torn West but also remote communities in South Africa, China, and Brazil. The book reveals how desperately and differently people reacted and how gravely the flu influenced the modern world, touching everything from medicine to business and from politics to poetry."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Science</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Influenza, like all viruses, is a parasite. Laura Spinney traces its long shadow over human history... Ms Spinney ties the virulence of Spanish flu to its genetic irregularities and does a good job of explaining containment strategies through epidemiology... In Europe and North America the first world war killed more than Spanish flu; everywhere else the reverse is true. Yet most narratives focus on the West... Ms Spinney's book goes some way to redress the balance."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>The Economist</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"This riveting study plots the course of the deadliest pandemic in history."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>The Sunday Times</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"Ambitious...Spinney delves into the unfolding tragedy around the globe, looking at Brazil, China, Iran, India, and Russia. There is fascinating detail."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>The Spectator</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"An excruciating report on the global disaster...Absorbing...Spinney's important book does not attempt to offer light reading. No less than four pandemics are predicted in the 21st century. At least one will take the form of flu. Vaccination is not cheap, because the flu virus is constantly mutating. Annual vaccines currently offer the best protection. Britain does still possess a National Health Service. The enduring message of Spinney's magisterial work is to underline just how crucial that remarkable service is to the future security of an unusually privileged nation. Let's hope the author's book is read with care by Theresa May."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>The Observer</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"Spinney's book is intensely readable, and instead of a strictly chronological account she circles around history, epidemiology and culture to give a panoramic portrait of the previous century's most deadly pandemic. We are probably due another one of these any day now, this is a great way to see what the future holds."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The Awl </i></b></i></b><br><br>"A masterful account of the possible origins, spread, and cultural consequences of this modern-day plague."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Geographical</i></b><br><br></i></b></p><h2>Paths of Pravritti and Nivritti, The [Paperback] [Feb 01, 2014] Swami Niranjananda Sarawati</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Black Mountain (An Isaiah Coleridge Novel)</h2><p><b>Ex-mob enforcer Isaiah Coledrige has hung out a shingle as a private eye in New York's Hudson Valley, and in his newest case, a seemingly simple murder investigation leads him to the most terrifying enemy he has ever faced</b><br><br>When a small-time criminal named Harold Lee turns up in the Ashokan reservoir--sans a heartbeat, head, or hands--the local Mafia capo hires Isaiah Coleridge to look into the matter.

Based on a comprehensive survey, undertaken over a period of more than 25 years, of virtually all printed sources that lead to these lines, this book quantitatively and qualitatively redefines the entire discipline of royal genealogy and outlines--definitively to date--American genealogical links to medieval kings and their forebears. Fully half of the 570 immigrants treated here have never appeared in earlier books on royal genealogy. Mr. Roberts, Director of Publications at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston, has also prepared an excellent summary of all pertinent royal genealogy research published through mid-1993. Although his book does not supersede such works as Weis&#39;s Ancestral Roots and Magna Charta Sureties, or Stuart&#39;s Royalty for Commoners, it builds on and outlines the best royal descents in these and similar works, providing a ready means of access to royal descent literature.

He lives in New York City.<br><br>www.fatresistancediet.com<br>www.broadwaybooks.com<b>one</b><br><b>Your Fat Is Not Your Fault</b><br>When I first met Lilly, she was thirty-five years old, a respected editor at a national news magazine--and more than fifty pounds overweight. On the medical history form that I give to all my new patients, she had summarized her primary health concern: "Can't lose weight."<br><br>"All my life it's been this way," she told me in one brief phrase with tears in her eyes. "Sometimes I can lose for a little while, taking off ten or even twenty pounds. But I have to starve myself to make that happen, and even then, it doesn't last."<br><br>Lilly's frustration was all the greater because she'd been following one diet or another ever since high school. In college, she'd supplemented her severely restrictive diet with a vigorous exercise routine. "But even when I dropped a few pounds, I always put them back again--and then some," she explained. "I don't know why I can't lose weight. Even when I'm good, I don't lose much. And if I slip for even a single day, I go up five pounds."<br><br>By the time Lilly came to see me, she weighed 214 pounds. Yet as I reviewed her diet and exercise plan, I could see that she was indeed making an effort. Every morning, she worked out for forty minutes--"even on Sundays and holidays," she insisted--and she'd gotten her daily intake down to 1,200 calories or less, mostly in the form of low-fat protein bars, chicken breasts, cottage cheese, and green salads. It was hard to see how she could exercise any more or eat any less. Yet the pounds clung stubbornly to her hips, thighs, and belly.<br><br>"Okay, doctor," she concluded with a sigh. "Tell me what else to cut out. At this point, I'll try anything."<br><br>"Frankly," I told her, "I don't want you to eat less. The problem isn't what you're eating--it's what you're not eating. So from this day forward, I want you to eat <i>more</i>."<br><br><b>Meet the Real Culprit: Leptin Resistance</b><br><br>Like so many other overweight Americans, Lilly was suffering from a condition she'd never heard of--a chemical imbalance that I believe is at the root of our nation's struggle with excess weight. The name of this syndrome is leptin resistance--a hormonal dysfunction that disrupts the body's natural ability to regulate appetite and metabolism. Unfortunately, most doctors are not yet aware of this condition. But my decades of clinical practice as an M.D., my success in treating patients with nutritional medicine, and my in-depth exploration of the latest scientific research have convinced me that if you--like Lilly--can't lose your excess weight, then you, too, are probably suffering from leptin resistance.<br><br>I believe that the discovery of leptin resistance is the key to freeing millions of overweight Americans from the tyranny of yo-yo dieting, food cravings, and a continual struggle with their weight. Have you ever had the feeling, as you looked at the bathroom scale or tried to button your jeans, that there was something wrong with your body, some stubborn disorder that simply refused to let you shed your excess weight? Well, I'm here to tell you, you were right. If you've tried in vain to lose weight, if you've fallen off every diet you've ever begun, if you've found your healthy intentions sabotaged by sugar cravings and starch binges, you haven't simply been failing or indulging yourself. You're not deficient in willpower or discipline. You're not weak or helpless or out of control. <i>You're simply suffering from a chemical imbalance</i>, a chemical imbalance you can correct by cutting out the wrong foods and beginning to eat the right ones.<br><br>Our bodies are designed to maintain a healthy weight, without any extra effort on our part. When our bodies are working properly, we eat what we want, and if we inadvertently gain a few pounds, the leptin in our system works to suppress our appetite, increase our metabolism, and reestablish our original weight. This is the mechanism that enables people to stay slim--the natural ability of our bodies to regulate themselves.<br><br>The problem comes when this natural ability is disrupted, most often by a condition known as <i>inflammation</i>. You may have heard of this syndrome, which has received a lot of attention in the media in recent years. Inflammation contributes to conditions like arthritis, asthma, allergies, and colitis. Many scientists also suspect that it plays a key role in heart disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. But there's another condition that some scientists now realize is caused by inflammation--obesity. This is because inflammation triggers leptin resistance, which in turn contributes to a sluggish metabolism, unchecked cravings, and, eventually, unwanted pounds.<br><br>Inflammation is part of your body's response to many different types of stress, including infection and injury. Sometimes inflammation creates visible signs and symptoms: redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Sometimes it's visible only on a cellular level, so that you--and your doctor--may not even be aware that you have it. But it's present more often than you might suspect; in fact, recent research has found two new causes of inflammation--the type of food you eat and excess weight itself.<br><br>So, I told Lilly, your body can get caught in a vicious circle. Inflammation disrupts your body's natural weight regulation system. As a result, you gain weight. Then the excess fat creates more inflammation, making the extra weight unusually difficult to lose. That's why, once begun, weight gain often continues. The weight itself is worsening the condition that caused you to put on weight in the first place.<br><br>If you've been a lifelong dieter, you've probably noticed this pattern yourself, without realizing what was causing it. Most people don't stabilize at a single unhealthy weight. Unless, like Lilly, they diet and exercise strenuously, they find that their weight has a tendency to increase. Sometimes they succeed in losing a few pounds--but they usually gain back more than they lost.<br><br>I'll explain leptin resistance and the link between inflammation and weight gain more fully in Chapter 2. For now, understand this: your weight problem is not a matter of will or discipline, but a chemical imbalance that, once corrected, holds the key to permanent weight loss. The good news is that this imbalance can be fairly easy to correct, simply by changing the foods you eat.<br><br>Once you make this change--adding the right fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and protein sources, and cutting back on sugar and unhealthy fats--you'll notice a remarkable change. Not only will you feel better and look better and find the pounds dropping almost effortlessly, but you'll also stop craving unhealthy foods. Most diets are based on what you can't have. In contrast the Fat Resistance Diet is based on a philosophy of fulfillment, providing your palate with all the tasty, delicious, and satisfying food you could ever want. True, burgers and fries are not on the Fat Resistance Diet, but once your taste buds are reawakened and your body reenergized, "fulfillment" takes on a new meaning. You won't feel hungry, and you won't even feel as if you're on a diet. I know, because I myself eat this way, and it's very satisfying. I'm able to say those magic words that everyone wishes were true: I eat whatever I want, and I never gain weight. If you follow the Fat Resistance Diet, within a few weeks, you'll be saying them, too.<br><b>Restoring Your Body's Natural Balance</b><br>Lilly was skeptical. But she agreed to give the Fat Resistance Diet a try. I explained to her the basic principles behind the diet: inflammation can be set off by eating certain foods, which she needed to avoid. But inflammation can also be cured by eating other types of foods, so she actually needed to eat more of those. Unfortunately, most American diets are rich in inflammatory ingredients and sadly lacking in anti-inflammatory nutrients. Red meat, white flour, sugar, and hydrogenated fats all inflame your body; so do French fries. On the other hand, berries and cherries, walnuts and almonds, whole grains, and fish help to heal inflammation, as do cabbage, broccoli, garlic, and flaxseeds. In the following chart, you'll find a list of the Top 40 Superfoods that will fast-track your cure for inflammation and enable you to lose weight.<br><br>When Lilly heard that I actually wanted her to eat more, she couldn't believe it. "You don't lose weight by eating more," she kept insisting. But I assured her that the Fat Resistance Diet was based strictly on mainstream science: cutting-edge research conducted by scientists at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Rockefeller universities, published in respected medical journals such as <i>JAMA</i>, the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. I'd prescribed versions of this diet to hundreds of patients, each of whom had gone on to lose substantial amounts of weight. Following my diet, they had achieved their ideal weight and avoided regaining the weight they'd lost.<br><br>Lilly agreed to follow an early version of the Fat Resistance Diet. To her joy, she soon began to lose weight at the rate of five pounds a month. (If you follow the plan laid out in this book, you can lose weight even more quickly--ten pounds in the first month, and five to ten pounds a month thereafter.)<br><br>Half a year later and thirty pounds lighter, Lilly was able to fit into her high school prom dress. But she didn't stop there. Sticking to the Fat Resistance Diet enabled Lilly to lose an additional four or five pounds a month, even though she was eating more food--and more types of food--than she had throughout her years of dieting.<br><br>By the time she'd been on the Fat Resistance Diet for one year, Lilly's weight had dropped to 150 pounds--the lightest she'd been since the age of fifteen. "I feel better than I've ever felt," she said in amazement. "Everyone tells me I look terrific--and not just because of the weight. My skin, my hair, even my fingernails a...</p><h2>The Rat On Fire</h2><p>After promising State Senator Mack, as a personal favor, to get rid of the rats that infest the tenements he owns, Jerry Fein hires professional arsonist Leo Proctor to do a surprisingly thorough job</p><p>He was a slumlord and lawyer and nobody&#39;s fool-and neither were the tenants who lived in Jerry Fein&#39;s rotting buildings.

Martin Beck and his colleagues feverishly comb Stockholm for the murderer, a demented and deadly rifleman, who has plans for even more chaos. As the tension builds and a feeling of imminent danger grips Beck, his investigation unearths evidence of police corruption. That�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s when an even stronger sense of responsibility and something like shame urge him into taking a series of drastic steps, which lead to a shocking disaster.</p><p><b>Maj Sj�wall </b>and <b>Per Wahl��</b>, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr Wahl��, who died in 1975, was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories, and novels. Maj Sj�wall is also a poet.The violent killing of a Swedish police captain while in hospital brings to light the brutality of his 40 years on the Stockholm police force. His history leaves Detective Martin Beck and his colleagues with plenty of suspects. Tom Weiner perfects the gravelly rumble of the hard-boiled but intellectual Beck as he makes his way through the dangerous case. Sj�wall&#39;s and Wahl��&#39;s descriptive prose, in tandem with Weiner&#39;s narration, enlivens the Scandinavian imagery, as well as the characters&#39; often-sordid surroundings. Scrutiny of modern law enforcement, with a strong indictment of indiscriminate brutality, flows throughout as a social theme. Gripping tension leads to a bleak and horrifying disaster but leaves us awaiting more from this crime series.

Bishop Kallistos (Ware) states in his foreword: [Hymn of Entry] offers nothing less than a fresh vision of theology, the church and the world a vision that is both original and yet genuinely traditional. The quality that characterizes this remarkable book is above all a sense of wholeness. The unity of the divine and human in the incarnate Christ, the unity of heaven and earth in the Divine Liturgy, the unity between theology and spirituality, between theology and life - such are the author&#39;s master-themes. Hymn of Entry is part of the CONTEMPORARY GREEK THEOLOGIANS SERIES.</p><p>Archimandrite Vasileios is the Abbot of Stavronikita Monastery on Mount Athos. He is regarded as the pioneer of the movement which led to the modern revival of monasticism on the Holy Mountain.Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>If You Give a Moose a Muffin</h2><p>If a big hungry moose comes to visit, you might give him a muffin to make him feel at home.

So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <i>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</i>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <i>wouldn't</i> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You never know <i>who</i> may drop by.

Though initially attracted out of sympathy, Peggy soon finds she has much in common with this sensitive, albeit enormous man. A romance ensues, but the unique connectedness they share -- something neither has ever felt before -- is cruelly interrupted by tragedy.Elizabeth McCracken is the recipient of the Harold Vursell Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the PEN/Winship Award.

A book based on her comic strip, <i>Minimum Security</i>, was published in 2005.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;This simply drawn graphic satire is largely message-driven, but the message is still entertaining and thought-provoking. As the lighthearted lead character shares what governments, corporations, and activists tell individual Americans to do to save the Earth, her cynical counterpart exposes the futility of these simple solutions. The truth is, even if each and every one of us switched to compact fluorescent bulbs and became vegetarians it would only be a drop in the bucket compared to the damage corporate and government policies are doing to the world environment. The story that binds these notions together is an upcoming alien invasion and a renegade bunny trying to end animal experimentation. The characters are crudely drawn with bare sets, but this style works in a tale in which the words are carrying so much weight. (The politicians have sharper teeth than the bears.) This book doesn't offer up any real answers to what is clearly portrayed as a frightening state of affairs&#x2013;it includes an animal uprising. However, it will inflame teens' passion about the environment and possibly open more eyes.<i>&#x2013;Jamie Watson, Harford County Public Library, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Animals provided comfort and interest to fill the blank hours in the trenches - bird-watching, for instance, was probably the single most popular hobby among officers. Soldiers went fishing in flooded shell holes, shot hares in no-man's land for the pot, and planted gardens in their trenches and billets. Nature was also sometimes a curse - rats, spiders and lice abounded, and disease could be biblical.</p><p>But above all, nature healed, and, despite the bullets and blood, it inspired men to endure. <i>Where Poppies Blow </i>is the unique story of how nature gave the British soldiers of the Great War a reason to fight, and the will to go on.</p></p><p>John Lewis-Stempel is an award-winning writer predominantly known for his books on nature and history. He lives in Herefordshire, on the very edge of England before it runs into Wales, and within a stone's throw (with a decent gust of wind) from where his family farmed in the 1300s.

They are her safety net as she climbs out of her crib, and they follow her as she toddles silently, unseen, past her unsuspecting parents and out the door.

Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her prot�g�e Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. With its imperfect but charming heroine and its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma is often seen as Jane Austen&#39;s most flawless work. The Penguin English Library - 100 paperbacks of the best fiction written in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Waiting For Yesterday: Pages From a Street Kid&#39;s Life (VIA Folios)</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction. Memoir. On these pages, fans of Michael Parenti&#39;s insightful political and historical writings are given a revealing picture of his early years as a youth in New York&#39;s East Harlem, along with some of the influences that helped shape his lifelong commitment to activism and social justice. Written with style and dash, WAITING FOR YESTERDAY is devilishly enjoyable and sometimes very touching. It provides delightful vignettes about growing up in a three-generation, working-class, Italian family, along with the amusing predicaments of a street kid&#39;s life. The book offers a cast of diverse and colorful characters, brought to life on the gritty streets where Parenti played as a boy, set against a backdrop of impoverished tenements, stoops, punitive classrooms, and a neighborhood church with its ornate celestial offerings. This book is graced with both vivid imagery and sharp political observation. Parenti challenges many of the stereotypes faced by Italian Americans and other ethnic groups. Here is a story that is both personal and broad-ranging, often sweet and occasionally bitter, the human comedy at its best.</p><p>Michael Parenti is an internationally known award-winning author and lecturer.

One creates pressure, the other provides freedom.<br><br>In the Old Way of life, as best-selling author, psychologist, and spiritual director Larry Crabb describes it, &#x201c;you have decided that what you most want out of life is within your reach, and you are doing whatever you believe it takes to get it.&#x201d; But in the New Way of life, &#x201c;you have realized that what you most want is beyond your reach, and you are trusting God for the satisfaction you seek. You want Him. Nothing less, not even His blessings, will do.&#x201d;<br><br>The Old Way&#x2013;the way most Christians define life and pursue fulfillment&#x2013;is fundamentally wrong and harmful. It leaves us tired, in bondage, and feeling distant from God. But the New Way brings true freedom and refreshment as we tap into the power to draw closer to God in a personal way.<br><br><i>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t always make life work. But we can </i>always<i> draw near to God. There is a different way to approach our problems. There is a NEW WAY to live.&#x201d; &#x2014;Larry Crabb</i></p><p><b>Dr. Larry Crabb</b> is the founder of New Way Ministries and a best-selling author, psychologist, and spiritual director who is known internationally not only through his many books, but also as a leading seminar and conference speaker for the past two decades. Some of his landmark books include <i>Inside Out, Finding God, The Marriage Builder, Connecting,</i> and <i>Shattered Dreams. </i>Larry currently serves as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Colorado Christian University, and has served on the faculties of Regent College, Grace Theological Seminary, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Illinois. He had a private practice in clinical psychology for ten years. Larry and his wife, Rachael, have two grown sons and two grandchildren, and live near Denver, Colorado.Two Paths<br><br>Right now, at this very moment, you&#x2019;re walking one of two paths through life.<br><br>Either<br><br>you&#x2019;ve decided that what you most want out of life is within your reach, and you&#x2019;re doing whatever you believe it<br>takes to get it<br><br>or<br><br>you&#x2019;ve realized that what you most want is beyond your reach, and you&#x2019;re trusting God for the satisfaction you<br>seek. You want Him. Nothing less, not even His blessings, will do.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the first path, your life is filled with pressure. Inside, where no one sees, your soul is weary. You see no way to step off the treadmill. Or life is going well, and you&#x2019;re satisfied. But you sense something&#x2019;s wrong, something&#x2019;s missing. The pressure is still there. <br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the second path, you have hope. Your soul may be weary, your interior world may be filled with struggles no one sees, but you have hope. At times you rest. Something is alive in you; the desire of your heart is not smothered. You can taste freedom. And the taste brings joy. The first path is the Old Way. It involves a quid-pro-quo arrangement with God or, if not with God, then with the order in the universe, with the rules that make life work. If you do what you should, then you get what you want, either from a moral God who rewards good behavior or from an<br>orderly world that you effectively use. It leaves you in control of how things turn out in your life. The Old Way promises a better life filled with good things that make you happy.<br><br>But it never delivers, though it may seem to for a long time. The Old Way doesn&#x2019;t work for one reason: You never keep your end of the bargain, not completely. No one does.<br><br>The second path is the New Way. In this arrangement, God first plants a desire in your heart, a longing that actually values His presence over His blessings; then He invites you to live out that desire, to abandon yourself to what you most want. It takes you out of control, but it sets you free. The New Way promises a better hope than the good things of life. It promises nearness to God, and it delivers, though not right away and often through suffering.<br><br>Most people live the Old Way all of their lives; most people who go to church live a religious version of the Old Way. It goes something like this: If you want good kids, raise them according to Christian principles. If you want a good marriage, understand a biblical model for marriage and live up to it as closely as you can.<br><br>If you want God to bless your ministry, follow godly principles of leadership. If you want to be emotionally healthy, practice spiritual disciplines and trust Jesus for your needs.<br><br>If you want close friends, learn to accept yourself and to be vulnerable, authentic, and forgiving.<br><br>People who live the Old Way believe the Law of Linearity, a law that states there is an A that leads to the B you want. Figure out what A is, do it, and you&#x2019;ll have the life you most desire. The pressure&#x2019;s on.<br><br>People who live the New Way believe the Law of Liberty. They come as they are. They do not bathe before they approach God. They come to God for the bath. They feel no pressure to change either their inner life or their outer life, but they desire change in both spheres. And they are eager to do whatever will create the opportunity for change, even if it means dipping themselves seven times in a muddy river or marching around an enemy&#x2019;s wall for seven days and blowing trumpets. They live for the truest desire of their hearts: to know God and to enjoy Him. They do not live for a better life in this world. And when their life here is hard, when things fall apart, they most clearly reveal who they are. They&#x2019;re citizens of another world who most want what this world can never provide. So they wisely indulge their deepest desire and trust God to reveal Himself to them. That&#x2019;s the Law of Liberty.<br><br>Most of us are living the Old Way. Some of us can feel the emptiness it never fills. We&#x2019;re working hard to make life work so we can feel good. The pressure&#x2019;s on.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a new way to live that takes the pressure off.

That nearly all of her ideas&#x2014;that women are entitled to seek an education, to own property, to get a divorce, and to vote&#x2014;are now commonplace is in large part because she worked tirelessly to extend the nation&#x2019;s promise of radical individualism to women.&nbsp;In this subtly crafted biography, the historian Lori D. Ginzberg narrates the life of a woman of great charm, enormous appetite, and extraordinary intellectual gifts who turned the limitations placed on women like herself into a universal philosophy of equal rights. Few could match Stanton&#x2019;s self-confidence; loving an argument, she rarely wavered in her assumption that she had won. But she was no secular saint, and her positions were not always on the side of the broadest possible conception of justice and social change. Elitism runs through Stanton&#x2019;s life and thought, defined most often by class, frequently by race, and always by intellect. Even her closest friends found her absolutism both thrilling and exasperating, for Stanton could be an excellent ally and a bothersome menace, sometimes simultaneously. At once critical and admiring, Ginzberg captures Stanton&#x2019;s ambiguous place in the world of reformers and intellectuals, describes how she changed the world, and suggests that Stanton left a mixed legacy that continues to haunt American feminism.</p><p>A professor of history and women&#x2019;s studies at Pennsylvania State University, Lori D. Ginzberg has written several books on women&#x2019;s history, including <i>Untidy Origins: A </i><i>Story of Woman&#x2019;s Rights in Antebellum New York</i>. She lives in Philadelphia.1 THE TWO WORLDS <br>OF ELIZABETH CADY <br>(1815&#x2013;1840) To hear Elizabeth Cady Stanton tell it, Johnstown, New York, where she was born in 1815, was a place of comfort and con�vention, privilege and patriarchy. Her parents, Daniel and Mar�garet Livingston Cady, were devoted to family, tradition, and the Federalist Party. They were strict and stodgy, and their children were raised according to old-fashioned norms of childhood, religion, class&#x2014;and, especially, gender. Church, school, and family taught only &#x201c;that everlasting no! no! no!&#x201d; and conspired to enforce &#x201c;the constant cribbing and crippling of a child&#x2019;s life.&#x201d; It struck the young Elizabeth Cady that &#x201c;everything we like to do is a sin, and . . . everything we dis�like is commanded by God or someone on earth.&#x201d; Only with her sister Margaret&#x2019;s complicity was she able to get over her &#x201c;infantile fear of punishment&#x201d; in order to have fun.1 It was a perfect setting against which to rebel, and, as Elizabeth Cady Stanton recalled fondly, she rebelled with gusto. <br>Provincial it was, but the world of Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s birth, while it seemed only to reinforce the traditional, pastoral life her father enjoyed, was far from static. The inhabitants of the town, an 1824 gazetteer reported, &#x201c;seem to be very industrious and intent on keeping pace, in every improvement, with the progress of things around them&#x201d; and, indeed, Johnstown was a local center for the industrial changes that had skirted other small towns. The nation&#x2019;s .rst glove and mitten factory had been founded there, in about 1808, and manufacturing was at the heart of Johnstown&#x2019;s economy; the very air of Stanton&#x2019;s childhood must have smelled of progress.2 Nor was the local elite of long standing. The family and Episcopal church con�gregation of Johnstown&#x2019;s founder, Sir William Johnson, all Loyalists, had left for Canada after the Revolution, leaving an open door for the likes of Daniel Cady. <br>For all their sense of established respectability and community leadership, the Cadys were, like most white residents of Upstate New York, new blood. Daniel Cady had been born in Columbia County in 1773, studied law in Albany, and moved the forty miles to Johnstown in 1798. Margaret Livingston, a dozen years his junior, had been born in the Hudson Valley to Revolutionary War hero James Livingston and his wife, Elizabeth Simpson Livingston. Although their own Elizabeth believed that the laws, norms, and values that structured men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lives in her childhood were unchanging and unchallenged, Daniel and Margeret Cady had already seen changes of various kinds. Not all of these were progressive in nature. Churches that had shown some openness to women&#x2019;s speech in the mid-eighteenth century were, by the early nineteenth, reasserting traditional forms of male authority. Near Margaret Cady&#x2019;s birthplace, Dutch traditions that had given married women greater property rights had been largely super�seded by more stringent English common law that declared the whole of a woman&#x2019;s inherited property her husband&#x2019;s. Even in politics, the barriers of sex had been less rigid, less seemingly absolute, in 1800 than they would be during Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s youth. In New Jersey, women who owned property could vote until 1807, when the legisla�ture restricted suffrage to white men, re.ecting a growing consensus that women had no role in political life. Indeed, the Revolution itself, while underscoring the political equality of greater numbers of white men, saw a narrowing of elite women&#x2019;s conventional access to public authority. Daniel Cady, stubbornly conservative, wished to hold on to what authority he had gained (cultural, familial, political, and eco�nomic) as long as possible.3 <br>Historians tend to mark 1815, the end of the War of 1812, and the year of Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s birth, as the start of a new era in American history. It was a time that would, before too long, seethe with changes in law, religion, trade, politics, transportation, class structures, and, of course, ideas about women. Vast changes would take place that the Cadys could not possibly imagine or predict. Indeed, among Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s generation of Americans would be the .rst women to attend college, once Oberlin formally admitted them in 1837; the .rst female doctors, once sisters Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell earned their medical degrees; and an astonishing array of female speakers, antislavery reformers, writers, editors, labor activists, educators, and, of course, advocates of woman suffrage. <br>But before imagining the change that would occur, consider the world, and the rules, into which these women, citizens of the United States, were born. In 1830, when Elizabeth Cady was .fteen, the common-law notion of coverture&#x2014;that is, the idea that wives were &#x201c;covered&#x201d; by their husbands&#x2019; protection&#x2014;virtually de.ned the laws of marriage. Once they married, women could not own or inherit prop�erty, sign a contract, or pursue their business interests in court. Although women tended to bear somewhat fewer children than they had a century earlier, childbearing was still frequent and deadly. Legal divorce, as opposed to less formal desertion, was rare, and custody of minor children went to the husband, who essentially &#x201c;owned&#x201d; their labor. The opportunities for middle- and upper-class women to live independently of men&#x2014;whether husbands, fathers, or brothers&#x2014; were few indeed, and it would not be until the very late nineteenth century that signi.cant numbers of them could do so. Unmarried women paid taxes just as men did, but they could not vote for the rep�resentatives who set their tax rates or give advice about how those taxes were spent. Women could not serve on a jury, though they were tried often enough for crimes; nor could they speak out about such crimes in most religious assemblies. They were barred both from men&#x2019;s colleges and from a wide array of occupations&#x2014;and not surpris�ingly, those they dominated, such as domestic service and prostitu�tion, were among the lowest paid. In cities, new commercial markets presented both opportunities and pitfalls for women; they ran shops and small manufactories, operated millinery businesses, opened schools, and did the grueling work that the growing upper classes expected of seamstresses, servants, and nursemaids. But if these enterprising women married, their wages were no longer their own, but their husbands&#x2019;. Over the next century, much of this&#x2014;.rst and mostly among the upper and middle classes&#x2014;would change. In the meantime, for all the rhetoric about the common man, Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s world was in many respects characterized by greater restric�tion, reinforced hierarchies, and frequent declarations that what America needed was more stability and tradition, not less. <br>The Cadys, who married in 1801, when Margaret was sixteen, .ourished in Johnstown and in this larger world, living in a large house on a corner of Main Street. Aided by his ties to Margaret&#x2019;s brother-in-law, the fabulously wealthy Peter Smith, Daniel Cady established himself as a lawyer, landowner, state legislator, and judge. In the year of Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, his neighbors elected him to Con�gress, where he served one term. The couple had eleven children, of whom only six would survive childhood; the only son among those, Eleazar, would die at twenty. <br>The Cady family&#x2019;s economic privilege and social authority are nearly invisible threads running through Stanton&#x2019;s recollections, unquestioned and, to Stanton, unproblematic. It was, rather, her fa�ther&#x2019;s intransigence about gender that formed the core of the story Elizabeth Cady Stanton told about her childhood. Her most vivid, and oft-repeated, story was that of a brilliant, boisterous, rebellious little girl, eleven years old, whose only living brother, Eleazar, had just died. How dark the household must have seemed. Distraught, she crawled into her father&#x2019;s lap, seeking to give and receive comfort. But her grieving, distracted father put his arm around her and sighed, &#x201c;Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!&#x201d; The sting of the father&#x2019;s remark, whether spiteful or unfeeling or simply careless, lingers. Every girl who has yearned to impress an accomplished or demanding father, every woman who has felt the slight of being thought less promising than her brothers, can relate to the insult. Elizabeth Cady, as it turned out, had more than enough reserves of self-esteem to survive the slap, though she never forgot it; not only was she as brilliant as the boys and men around her, but she knew it. She was, as one historian puts it, &#x201c;singularly unaf.icted with psychological insecurity,&#x201d; and she quickly put her extraordinary self-con.dence to work.4 The child, as the woman later recalled, vowed to make her father happy by being all a son could have been, thus providing a rationale for her grand ambi�tions. But the political moral that she took from this childhood affront was the germ of something even larger: her recognition that society&#x2019;s preference for and pride in boys dwarfed girls&#x2019; lives, limited their opportunities, and were used to justify the denial of woman&#x2019;s rights. She took this insult very personally indeed. <br>Is it possible to sympathize, however grudgingly, with Judge Cady? There is every evidence that he loved his daughters, and even in sigh�ing over the limitations of Elizabeth&#x2019;s sex, he surely knew that this one was especially bright. But the man had just lost his only living son, at an age when the young man&#x2019;s promise was evident but his path not clearly marked, and at a time when a man such as the judge could reasonably rest his ambitions for succession only on boys. Surely he envisioned Eleazar, who had just graduated from Union College, fol�lowing in his footsteps, perhaps joining him in the law of.ce or at court. It is possible to read Daniel Cady&#x2019;s comment to his daughter not simply as a putdown, though it surely was that, but also as an acknowledgment that her intellect and her wit would in fact have found more expansive arenas if she had been a boy. Elizabeth&#x2019;s father was neither so wrong nor uniquely old-fashioned in feeling a twinge of regret that this gifted child was a girl, for in the judge&#x2019;s world, and pretty much everyplace else, the barriers that limited her sex were real indeed. <br>To hear Stanton tell it, she spent her girlhood days trying to impress her learned father, live up to the standards set by her brother, and learn from the law students who wandered through the house. That the household was not composed exclusively of men seems largely to have escaped her notice. There is little of Margaret Liv�ingston Cady in her daughter&#x2019;s account, and her appearances are gen�erally fairly passive. To her daughter, Mrs. Cady was simply &#x201c;a tall, queenly looking woman,&#x201d; a female enforcer of the &#x201c;Puritan ideas,&#x201d; and the reason that &#x201c;fear, rather than love, of God and parents alike, pre�dominated&#x201d; in the household. It was she, presumably, who often placed the young Elizabeth &#x201c;under punishment for what, in those days, were called &#x2018;tantrums&#x2019;&#x201d; but that Stanton insisted were &#x201c;justi.�able acts of rebellion against the tyranny of those in authority.&#x201d;5 But Margaret Cady demonstrated both a strong will and the capacity to change; years later, in 1867, she signed a woman suffrage petition and was, according to her granddaughter Harriot, &#x201c;a dyed-in-the-wool Abolitionist,&#x201d; even a &#x201c;Garrisonian extremist.&#x201d;6 However distant and disciplined she may have been, it was not Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s &#x201c;queenly&#x201d; mother alone who upheld the family&#x2019;s conservative atti�tudes. Unfortunately, neither Stanton&#x2019;s account nor other historical documents offer clues about what ambivalence Margaret Cady might have felt about her rebellious daughter. <br>If, in Stanton&#x2019;s recollections, Judge Cady embodied the hard-line patriarchal attitudes that shaped his daughter&#x2019;s rebellion, Mrs. Cady was the regal exemplar of discipline, and Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s younger sister Margaret was her &#x201c;fearless and self-reliant&#x201d; companion, the other women in the Cady household appear largely as the enforcers of conventional attitudes about women&#x2019;s place. Sister Harriet Cady, later Eaton, maintained a tight grip over Elizabeth Stanton&#x2019;s decisions even late in life, and often made the Stanton children miserable with restraint. Tryphena, the eldest, was conservative to her very bones. Not only would she oppose her younger sister&#x2019;s radical proclamations and actions, but, as Harriot Stanton Blatch recalled, &#x201c; &#x2018;Aunty By&#x2019; had a leaning to the southern side in Civil War days.&#x201d; Even Margaret Cady was, as her granddaughter recalled, &#x201c;much freer and .ner . . . without the aunts weaving nets of convention about her.&#x201d;7 <br>Gender conventions were not the only vestiges of tradition in the Cady household. Among Stanton&#x2019;s most quoted reminiscences are stories about the &#x201c;three colored men, Abraham, Peter, and Jacob, who acted as menservants in our youth.&#x201d; Peter in particular evoked the &#x201c;most pleasant recollections,&#x201d; for Stanton recalled that the little girls followed him to &#x201c;the negro pew&#x201d; at their otherwise all-white church, to celebrations of the Fourth of July, and on various river-rafting expe�ditions. But Peter Teabout was not simply a &#x201c;manservant&#x201d;; he was a slave&#x2014;and he likely remained one until 1827, when the last slaves were .nally, grudgingly, emancipated in the state of New York.8 <br>Daniel Cady was hardly unique in holding slaves in Montgomery County, New York. Johnstown&#x2019;s founder, Sir William Johnson, had brought slaves to central New York in the mid-eighteenth century, and by the time the Cadys arrived, revolutionary declarations of liberty notwithstanding, the practice of holding people in bondage had expanded. Five hundred and eighty-eight enslaved African Americans lived in the county in 1790, and 712 in 1810; by 1820, when Eliza�beth Cady was .ve, 40 percent of the 152 African Americans in Johnstown still lived as slaves. Only in 1799 had the state legislature passed a law for gradual, and compensated, emancipation; a very few years before Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, an African American man or woman in her county remained almost twice as likely to be a slave as to be free. Finally, on July 4, 1827, slavery was ended in New York. African Americans, refusing to have their day of emancipation eclipsed by their white neighbors&#x2019; own independence, pointedly waited until the following day, the .fth of July, to hold celebrations around the state.9 <br>Stanton never mentioned that day of emancipation, neither to re.ect on its implications for her father nor to consider its meaning for the supposedly greatly cherished Peter. Is it unfair to have expected an eleven-year-old to notice? By her own account she was an unusually alert child, exceptionally sensitive to injustice and mat�ters of law. Even as a young girl, she claimed, she found in the restric�tions on married women&#x2019;s property ownership deeply personal insults, and had plotted to cut them out of her father&#x2019;s legal tomes. Certainly she seethed when one of the judge&#x2019;s law students, Henry Bayard, upon being shown Elizabeth&#x2019;s new Christmas gifts, teased, &#x201c;if in due time you should be my wife, those ornaments would be mine.&#x201d;10 Surely a young woman who could be so vexed about some coral trin�kets would be affected by the knowledge that a beloved companion and chaperone of her youth was himself her father&#x2019;s property. <br>Furthermore, it is hard to imagine that the momentous emancipa�tion day passed her by entirely. The young Elizabeth Cady was enthralled with public events, and loved &#x201c;attending court&#x201d; with Peter, learning about the law, and participating in the &#x201c;numerous and pro�tracted&#x201d; gatherings surrounding each Fourth of July.11 One wonders how she could have remained untouched by the celebrations and f�tes that took place in honor of emancipation. She felt no qualms, then or later, about criticizing her father&#x2019;s adherence to convention where the st...</p><h2>Orhan&#39;s Inheritance</h2><p><b><i>They found him inside one of seventeen cauldrons in the courtyard, steeping in an indigo dye two shades darker than the summer sky.

In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

This is the day that will change their lives forever. With the German occupation threatening their family's safety, the boys' parents decide Maurice and Joseph must disguise themselves and flee to their older brothers in the free zone.<br> <br> Surviving the long journey will take every scrap of ingenuity and courage they can muster. And if they hope to elude the Nazis, they must never, under any circumstances, admit to being Jewish.<br> <br> The boys travel by train, by ferry, and on foot, facing threats from strangers and receiving help from unexpected quarters. Along the way they must adapt to the unfamiliar world beyond their city&#x2015;and find a way to be true to themselves even as they conceal their identities.<br> <br> Based on an autobiographical novel by Joseph Joffo and adapted with the author&#x2019;s input, this true story offers a harrowing but inspiring glimpse of a childhood cut short.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Joffo was born in Paris in 1931. He is the author of several books, but he is best known for his memoir <em>A Bag of Marbles</em>, published in 1973. It has been translated into eighteen languages, and in 1975 it was adapted to film. Like many of Joffo's books, <em>A Bag of Marbles</em> was based on his life story. After the war Joseph, his mother, and his brothers returned safely to Paris. His father died in a concentration camp.</p><p>"This <strong>marvelously conceived and executed</strong> graphic memoir, adapted from Joffo's 1973 book of the same name, tells the story of four Jewish brothers who spend WWII hiding from Nazi soldiers in Vichy France. When the Germans arrive, the boys' father sends them off in pairs to separate destinations, instructing them never to reveal their Jewish identities to anyone. The two younger boys, Jo (the author) and Maurice, travel from city to city, always one step ahead of arrest. Sometimes they're saved by decent French citizens ('Oh, the children are with me,' says a priest, casually). More often, desperation makes the boys quick-witted, as when they persuade an interrogator that what appears to be circumcision is the result of surgery for adhesions. The brothers' courage, Joffo makes clear in the story's early pages, has its source in their father's valor. He dies in the camps, but his wife and sons survive. Bailly's artwork carries much of the story's emotional impact&#x2015;every character is drawn with care, and every scene is crammed with atmospheric detail. <strong>Not to be missed.</strong>" &#x2015;starred, <em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The opening scene in this graphic novel (adapted from Joffo's 1973 adult memoir of the same name) features the author at ten years old, crying over a lost marble. But for Jews in Nazi-occupied Paris, innocence is fleeting: two years later, the now-world-weary boy has much more to cry about as he observes, 'The Nazis haven't taken my life away yet, but they've stolen my childhood.' During those two years young Jo and his brother Maurice manage to stay one step ahead of the Germans, scurrying from one place to the next as they travel through southern France, hoping to reunite with their two grown brothers near the Italian border. Despite the tragedy and danger inherent in the wartime setting, it's not all gloom and doom. Jo and Maurice are likable, impressively resourceful boys&#x2015;no matter the city or town, the brothers forge fast friendships, flashing impish grins as they plan their latest scheme. <strong>The book's relatively busy layout is balanced by Bailly's gorgeously detailed illustrations</strong>&#x2015;one can almost smell the sea air as the brothers bum around the coastal town of Menton. A map of France during the war, a glossary, and an author's note are included in this <strong>welcome addition to the rich Holocaust literary canon.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"One almost never hears the sentence, 'I'm reading a Holocaust book for fun,' but parts of this memoir of French Jews fleeing the Occupation read like an adventure story.<br> No one would describe this book as a thriller, but it has false identities and escapes through the forest in the dark of night. Ten-year-old Joseph even looks a bit like Tintin, with his skinny frame and blond hair. For a brief portion of the war, he spends his days eating pastries and watching the same movie over and over again. (Bailly's pictures of the free zone in Marseille are gorgeous.) But the memoir is always a moment away from tragedy. In real life, Joseph Joffo's father died in a concentration camp, and the last image in the story highlights his framed, sepia-toned photo. A few scenes are deeply poignant. Early in the book, Joseph is told to deny his Jewish identity, and he asks, 'What is...a Jew?' His father says, 'Well, it's kind of embarrassing, but...I don't really know.' At the time, Joffo probably didn't think he was living an adventure story. He had to flee from one zone of France to another, hoping he wouldn't be caught by the Nazis.<br> For the 128 pages of this graphic novel, though, <strong>readers can pretend this is an awfully big adventure, and they'll keep flipping pages</strong>, hoping it doesn't turn into another story altogether." &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Ten-years-old at the start of the story, Joffo recalls his Jewish family planning their escape from Occupied France during World War II. Tension runs through the story as he and his brother set off on the long journey to the Free Zone, where they plan to meet up with their older brothers. Along the way the boys must hide their Jewish identity, evade train security, and find a passeur, or guide, to take them past guard posts and fences to safe territory. Readers are never allowed to forget the danger the boys are in as they encounter friends and foes and attempt to discern whom they can trust. <strong>Bailly's painterly artwork is well suited to the compelling, well-told narrative.</strong> Unfortunately, it is crowded on dense, dialogue-heavy and tightly packed pages, preventing readers to view more closely the detailed, layered artwork. This title will appeal to readers interested in memoirs about World War II and has enough action to hold their attention. <strong>It's a welcome addition to graphic-novel collections</strong>, but layout problems preclude it from being a must-have." &#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>To Be Young, Gifted and Black: An Informal Autobiography</h2><p>A special autobiography told in a very special voice.

This stay-at-home mom has no job skills, an out-of-control sixteen-year-old son, a talkative fourteen-year-old who&#x2019;s suddenly gone silent, a six-year-old daughter whose heart is broken, an ex-husband whose younger girlfriend is expecting their baby and two best friends who think she&#x2019;s somehow qualified to help them open a fitness spa for women. <br><br>But if Maddie is a tad on edge with all that on her plate, it&#x2019;s nothing compared to the chaos that ensues when she discovers that her son&#x2019;s baseball coach has feelings for her and the whole town disapproves. Maddie&#x2019;s faced a lot of challenges lately with strength and resolve, but Cal Maddox may turn out to be more than she can handle. Then again, he could just be the one man in all of South Carolina who can help her find serenity.</p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.Maddie focused on the wide expanse of mahogany stretching between her and the man who'd been her husband for twenty years. Half her life. She and William Henry Townsend had been high-school sweethearts in Serenity, South Carolina. They'd married before their senior year in college, not because she was pregnant as some of her hastily married friends had been, but because they hadn't wanted to wait one more second before starting their lives together.<br><br>Then, after they'd graduated, there had been the exhausting years of medical school for Bill, when she'd worked as an entry-level bookkeeper, making poor use of her degree in business, just to keep their heads above water financially. And then the joyous arrival of three kids&#x2014;athletic, outgoing Tyler, now sixteen, their jokester, Kyle, fourteen, and their surprise blessing, Katie, who was just turning six.<br><br>They'd had the perfect life in the historic Townsend family home in Serenity's oldest neighborhood, surrounded by family and lifelong friends. The passion they'd once shared might have cooled ever so slightly, but they'd been happy.<br><br>Or so she'd thought until the day a few months ago when Bill had looked at her after dinner, his expression as distant as a stranger's, and calmly explained that he was moving out and moving on...with his twenty-four-year-old nurse, who was already pregnant. It was, he'd said, one of those things that just happened. He certainly hadn't planned to fall out of love with Maddie, much less <em>in</em> love with someone else.<br><br>Maddie's first reaction hadn't been shock or dismay. Nope, she'd laughed, sure that her intelligent, compassionate Bill was incapable of such a pitiful clich�. Only when his distant expression remained firmly in place did she realize he was stone-cold serious. Just when life had settled into a comfortable groove, the man she'd loved with all her heart had traded her in for a newer model.<br><br>In a disbelieving daze, she'd sat by his side while he'd explained to the children what he was doing and why. He'd omitted the part about a new little half brother or sister being on the way. Then, still in a daze, she'd watched him move out.<br><br>And after he'd gone, she'd been left to deal with Tyler's angry acting out, with Kyle's slow descent into unfamiliar silence and Katie's heartbroken sobs, all while she herself was frozen and empty inside.<br><br>She'd been the one to cope with their shock when they found out about the baby, too. She'd had to hide her resentment and anger, all in the name of good parenting, maturity and peace. There were days she'd wanted to curse Dr. Phil and all those cool, reasoned episodes on which he advised parents that the needs of the children came first. When, she'd wondered, did her needs start to count?<br><br>The day of being completely on her own as a single parent was coming sooner than she'd anticipated. All that was left was getting the details of the divorce on paper, spelling out in black and white the end of a twenty-year marriage. Nothing on those pieces of paper mentioned the broken dreams. Nothing mentioned the heartache of those left behind. It was all reduced to deciding who lived where, who drove which car, the amount of child support&#x2014;and the amount of temporary spousal support until she could stand on her own feet financially or until she married again.<br><br>Maddie listened to her attorney's impassioned fight against the temporary nature of that last term. Helen Decatur, who'd known both Maddie and Bill practically forever, was a top-notch divorce attorney with a statewide reputation. She was also one of Maddie's best friends. And when Maddie was too tired and too sad to fight for herself, Helen stepped in to do it for her. Helen was a blond barracuda in a power suit, and Maddie had never been more grateful.<br><br>"This woman worked to help you through medical school," Helen lashed out at Bill, in her element on her own turf. "She gave up a promising career of her own to raise your children, keep your home, help manage your office and support your rise in the South Carolina medical community. The fact that you have a professional reputation far outside of Serenity is because Maddie worked her butt off to make it happen. And now you expect her to struggle to find her place in the workforce? Do you honestly think in five years or even ten she'll be able to give your children the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed?" She pinned Bill with a look that would have withered anyone else. His demeanor reflected a complete lack of interest in Maddie or her future.<br><br>That was when Maddie knew it was well and truly over. All the rest, the casual declaration that he'd been cheating on her, the move, none of that had convinced her that it really was the end of her marriage. Until this moment, until she'd seen the uncaring expression in her husband's once-warm brown eyes, she hadn't accepted that Bill wouldn't suddenly come to his senses and tell her it had all been a horrible mistake.<br><br>She'd drifted along until this instant, deep in denial and hurt, but no more. Anger, more powerful than anything she'd ever felt in her life, swept through her with a force that brought her to her feet.<br><br>"Wait," she said, her voice trembling with outrage. "I'd like to be heard."<br><br>Helen regarded her with surprise, but the stunned expression on Bill's face gave Maddie the courage to go on. He hadn't expected her to fight back. She could see now that all her years of striving to please him, of putting him first, had convinced him that she had no spine at all, that she'd make it easy for him to walk away from their family&#x2014;from <em>her</em>&#x2014;without a backward glance. He'd probably been gloating from the minute she suggested trying to mediate a settlement, rather than letting some judge set the terms of their divorce.<br><br>"You've managed to reduce twenty years of our lives to this," she said, waving the settlement papers at him. "And for what?"<br><br>She knew the answer, of course. Like so many other middle-aged men, his head had been turned by a woman barely half his age.<br><br>"What happens when you tire of Noreen?" she asked. "Will you trade her in, too?"<br><br>"Maddie," he said stiffly. He tugged at the sleeves of his monogrammed shirt, fiddling with the eighteen-carat-gold cuff links she'd given him just six months ago for their twentieth anniversary. "You don't know anything about my relationship with Noreen."<br><br>She managed a smile. "Sure I do. It's about a middle-aged man trying to feel young again. I think you're pathetic."<br><br>Calmer now that she'd finally expressed her feelings, she turned to Helen. "I can't sit here anymore. Hold out for whatever you think is right. He's the one in a hurry."<br><br>Shoulders squared, chin high, Maddie walked out of the lawyer's office and into the rest of her life.<br><br>An hour later Maddie had exchanged her prim knit suit and high heels for a tank top, shorts and well-worn sneakers. Oblivious to the early-morning heat, she walked the mile to her much-hated gym, with its smell of sweat pervading the air. Set on a side street just off Main, the gym had once been an old-fashioned dime store. The yellowed linoleum on the floor harked back to that era and the dingy walls hadn't seen a coat of paint since Dexter had bought the place back in the 1970s.<br><br>Since the walk downtown had done nothing at all to calm her, Maddie forced herself to climb onto the treadmill, put the dial at the most challenging setting she'd ever attempted and run. She ran until her legs ached, until the perspiration soaked her chin-length, professionally highlighted hair and ran into her eyes, mingling with the tears that, annoyingly, kept welling up.<br><br>Suddenly a perfectly manicured hand reached in front of her, slowed the machine, then cut it off.<br><br>"We thought we'd find you here," Helen said, still in her power suit and Jimmy Choo stiletto heels. Helen was probably one of the only women in all of Serenity who'd ever owned a pair of the expensive shoes.<br><br>Beside her, Dana Sue Sullivan was dressed in comfortable pants, a pristine T-shirt and sneakers. She was the chef and owner of Serenity's fanciest restaurant&#x2014;meaning it used linen tablecloths and napkins and had a menu that extended beyond fried catfish and collard greens. Sullivan's New Southern Cuisine, as the dark green and gold-leaf sign out front read, was a decided step up from the diner on the outskirts of town that simply said Good Eatin' on the window and used paper place mats on the Formica tabletops.<br><br>Maddie climbed off the treadmill on wobbly legs and wiped her face with the towel Helen handed her. "Why are you two here?"<br><br>Both women rolled their eyes.<br><br>"Why do you think?" Dana Sue asked in her honeyed drawl. Her thick, chestnut hair was pulled back with a clip, but already the humidity had curls springing free. "We came to see if you want any help in killing that snake-bellied slime who ran out on you."<br><br>"Or the mindless pinup he plans to marry," Helen added. "Though I am somewhat hesitant to recommend murder as a solution, being an officer of the court and all."<br><br>Dana Sue nudged her in the ribs. "Don't go soft now. You said we'd do <em>anything,</em> if it would make Maddie feel better."<br><br>Maddie actually managed a faint grin. "Fortunately for both of you, my revenge fantasies don't run to murder."<br><br>"What, then?" Dana Sue asked, looking fascinated. "Personally, after I kicked Ronnie's sorry butt out of the house, I wanted to see him run over by a train."<br><br>"Murder's too quick," Maddie said. "Besides, there are the children to consider. Scum that he is, Bill is still their father. I have to remind myself of that on an hourly basis just to keep my temper in check."<br><br>"Fortunately, Annie was just as mad at her daddy as I was," Dana Sue said. "I suppose that's the good side of having a teenage daughter. She could see right through his shenanigans. I think she knew what was going on even before I did. She stood on the front steps and applauded when I tossed him out."<br><br>"Okay, you two," Helen interrupted, "as much fun as it is listening to you compare notes, can we go someplace else to do it? My suit's going to stink to high heaven if we don't get out in the fresh air soon."<br><br>"Don't you both need to get to work?" Maddie asked.<br><br>"I took the afternoon off," Helen said. "In case you wanted to get drunk or something."<br><br>"And I don't have to be at the restaurant for two hours," Dana Sue said, then studied Maddie with a considering look. "How drunk can you get in that amount of time?"<br><br>"Given the fact that there's not a single bar open in Serenity at this hour, I think we can forget about me getting drunk," Maddie noted. "Though I do appreciate the sentiment, that's probably for the best."<br><br>"I have the makings of margaritas at my place," Helen offered.<br><br>"And we all know how loopy I get on one of those," Maddie retorted, shuddering at the memory of their impromptu pity party a few months back when she'd told them about Bill's plan to leave her. "I think I'd better stick to Diet Coke. I have to pick the kids up at school."<br><br>"No, you don't," Dana Sue said. "Your mama's going to do it."<br><br>Maddie's mouth gaped. Her mother had uttered two words when Tyler was born and repeated them regularly ever since: no babysitting. She'd been adamant about it then, and she'd stuck to it for sixteen years.<br><br>"How on earth did you pull that off?" she asked, a note of admiration in her voice.<br><br>"I explained the situation," Dana Sue said with a shrug. "Your mother is a perfectly reasonable woman. I don't know why the two of you have all these issues."<br><br>Maddie could have explained, but it would take the rest of the afternoon. More likely, the rest of the week. Besides, Dana Sue had heard most of it a thousand times.<br><br>"So, are we going to my place?" Helen asked.<br><br>"Yes, but not for the margaritas," Maddie said. "It took me the better part of two days to get over that last batch you made. I need to start looking for a job tomorrow."<br><br>"No, you don't," Helen said.<br><br>"Oh? Did you finally get Bill to hand over some sort of windfall?"<br><br>"That, too," Helen said, her smile smug.<br><br>Maddie studied her two friends intently. They were up to something. She'd bet her first alimony check on it. "Tell me," she commanded.<br><br>"We'll talk about it when we get to my place," Helen said.<br><br>Maddie turned to Dana Sue. "Do you know what's going on?"<br><br>"I have some idea," Dana Sue said, barely containing a grin.<br><br>"So, the two of you have been plotting something," Maddie concluded, not sure how she felt about that. She loved these two women like sisters, but every time they got some crazy idea, one of them invariably landed in trouble. It had been that way since they were six. She was pretty sure that was why Helen had become a lawyer, because she'd known the three of them were eventually going to need a good one.<br><br>"Give me a hint," she pleaded. "I want to decide if I should take off now."<br><br>"Not even a tiny hint," Helen said. "You need to be in a more receptive frame of mind."<br><br>"There's not enough Diet Coke in the world to accomplish that," Maddie responded.<br><br>Helen grinned. "Thus the margaritas."<br><br>"I made some killer guacamole," Dana Sue added. "And I got a big ole bag of those tortilla chips you like, too, though all that salt will eventually kill you."<br><br>Maddie looked from one to the other and sighed. "With you two scheming behind my back, something tells me I'm doomed anyway."<br><br></p><h2>The Legend of Mackinac Island</h2><p>A beautiful tale of the painted turtle Makinauk, his animal friends, and their discovery of new lands and long-lasting friendship.</p><p>Legend and folklore of the Great Lakes region tell us that long ago, there was a large great turtle who floated quietly and gently upon a world made only of water.

The 1660s represent a turning point in English history, and for the main events - the Restoration, the Dutch War, the Great Plague, the Fire of London - Pepys provides a definitive eyewitness account. As well as recording public and historical events, Pepys paints a vivid picture of his personal life, from his socializing and amorous entanglements, to his theatre-going and his work at the Navy Board. Unequalled for its frankness, high spirits and sharp observations, the diary is both a literary masterpiece and a marvellous portrait of seventeenth-century life. Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) achieved fame as a naval administrator and a friend and colleague of the powerful and learned. For nearly ten years he kept a private diary in which he recorded life in Restoration London, commenting on politics, public events, and private matters. If you enjoyed The Diary of Samuel Pepys, you might like Alexander Pope&#39;s The Rape of the Lock and Other Major Writings, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;&#39;For anyone who wants to get to grips with Pepys but quails at more than a million words, here is the solution: Robert Latham&#39;s beautifully judged abridgment of the Diary.

With admirable vigor, narrator Michael Maloney tries to give a sense of Pepys's development over the tumultuous decade that the secret journals cover. But he seems distracted, as if struggling with the seventeenth-century diction, and comes off a bit flat and awkward.

Lose on the track and you go home. Lose with a load of whiskey and you go to jail.&#x201d; &#x2014;Junior Johnson, NASCAR legend and one-time whiskey runner<br><br>Today&#x2019;s NASCAR is a family sport with 75 million loyal fans, which is growing bigger and more mainstream by the day. Part Disney, part Vegas, part Barnum &amp; Bailey, NASCAR is also a multibillion-dollar business and a cultural phenomenon that transcends geography, class, and gender. But dark secrets lurk in NASCAR&#x2019;s past. <br><br><i>Driving with the Devil</i> uncovers for the first time the true story behind NASCAR&#x2019;s distant, moonshine-fueled origins and paints a rich portrait of the colorful men who created it. Long before the sport of stock-car racing even existed, young men in the rural, Depression-wracked South had figured out that cars and speed were tickets to a better life. With few options beyond the farm or factory, the best chance of escape was running moonshine. Bootlegging offered speed, adventure, and wads of cash&#x2014;if the drivers survived. <i>Driving with the Devil</i> is the story of bootleggers whose empires grew during Prohibition and continued to thrive well after Repeal, and of drivers who thundered down dusty back roads with moonshine deliveries, deftly outrunning federal agents. The car of choice was the Ford V-8, the hottest car of the 1930s, and ace mechanics tinkered with them until they could fly across mountain roads at 100 miles an hour. <br><br>After fighting in World War II, moonshiners transferred their skills to the rough, red-dirt racetracks of Dixie, and a national sport was born. In this dynamic era (1930s and &#x2019;40s), three men with a passion for Ford V-8s&#x2014;convicted criminal Ray Parks, foul-mouthed mechanic Red Vogt, and crippled war veteran Red Byron, NASCAR&#x2019;s first champion&#x2014;emerged as the first stock car &#x201c;team.&#x201d; Theirs is the violent, poignant story of how moonshine and fast cars merged to create a new sport for the South to call its own. <br><br><i>Driving with the Devil</i> is a fascinating look at the well-hidden historical connection between whiskey running and stock-car racing. NASCAR histories will tell you who led every lap of every race since the first official race in 1948. <i>Driving with the Devil</i> goes deeper to bring you the excitement, passion, crime, and death-defying feats of the wild, early days that NASCAR has carefully hidden from public view. In the tradition of Laura Hillenbrand&#x2019;s <i>Seabiscuit</i>, this tale not only reveals a bygone era of a beloved sport, but also the character of the country at a moment in time.</p><p>Neal Thompson is a veteran journalist who has worked for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>, and whose magazine stories have appeared in <i>Outside</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Backpacker</i>, and <i>Men&#x2019;s Health</i>.

Why do they live at all?<br><br> &#x2014;William Faulkner<br><br> 1<br><br> &#x201c;NASCAR is no longer a southern sport&#x201d;<br><br> The old man has seen a lot. Sometimes too much. Police in his rearview mirror. The inside of jail cells. Friends and family lowered into the ground. Race cars carving deadly paths into crowds. He&#x2019;s seen stacks of money, too&#x2014;some coming, some going.<br><br> Those visions, those memories, all link into a story. The real story.<br><br> The old man sits behind his orderly desk sipping a Coke, almost as if he&#x2019;s waiting for someone to come through the door and ask, &#x201c;Tell me what it was like.&#x201d; It is the start of the twenty-first century, but he is dressed in the style of an earlier era: white shirt and narrow black tie, a gray jacket and felt fedora on a nearby hook&#x2014;the same uniform he&#x2019;s worn since FDR&#x2019;s first term, except for summers, when the fedora is swapped for a straw boater. Raymond Parks is a creature of habit. He doesn&#x2019;t need to be here each day. With moonshining profits earned as a teen, he bought liquor stores, then vending machines, which funded real estate deals and other sources of income (some legal, some not quite). Far from his squalid youth, Parks is worth plenty, more than he could have imagined. He&#x2019;s sold off most of his empire&#x2014;the houses, the land, the nightclubs, the vending machines, and all of his liquor stores except one. Still, he arrives each morning to putter around the office, make phone calls, check his accounts.<br><br> Next door, customers trickle into the one package store Parks has kept, the one he&#x2019;s owned for two-thirds of a century. They buy flasks of Jack Daniels and fifths of Wild Turkey from a brother-in-law who has worked for Parks since World War II. Even now, it&#x2019;s an ironic business for a teetotaler who&#x2014;as a so-called moonshine &#x201c;baron&#x201d; and &#x201c;kingpin&#x201d;&#x2014;used to make, deliver, and profit nicely from illegal corn whiskey. Outside, crews of Georgia road workers jackhammer into his parking lot, part of a road-widening project that brings Atlanta&#x2019;s Northside Avenue closer to the bespectacled old man&#x2019;s front door each day.<br><br> Parks is ninety-one, though he looks two decades younger. In his twilight years, this office has become a sanctuary and the place he goes to rummage through the past. The room contains the secrets of NASCAR&#x2019;s origins. On cluttered walls and shelves are the dinged-up and tarnished trophies and loving cups, the yellowed newspaper articles, the vivid black-and-white photographs of men and machines, of crowds and crack-ups, which tell part of the story of how NASCAR came to be.<br><br> Take a look: one of Parks&#x2019;s drivers is balanced impossibly on two right wheels in the north turn of the old Beach-and-Road course at Daytona; the wizard mechanic who honed his skills juicing up whiskey cars poses on the fender of a 1939 Ford V-8 coupe outside his &#x201c;24-Hour&#x201d; garage, wearing his trademark white T-shirt, white pants, and white socks; a driver stands next to his race car in front of Parks&#x2019;s office / liquor store in 1948, a dozen trophies lined up before him and Miss Atlanta smiling at his side.<br><br> Parks is proud of the recent photos, too. It took many years for him to return to the sport he abandoned in 1952. When he did, NASCAR stars such as Dale Earnhardt&#x2014;his arm affectionately around Parks&#x2019;s shoulder&#x2014;embraced him as their sport&#x2019;s unsung pioneer.<br><br> There were good reasons he&#x2019;d left the sport a half century earlier. That world contained dark secrets like prison and murder, greed and betrayal, the frequent maiming of friends and colleagues, their innocent fans, and the violent death of a young child. Parks keeps a few mementos from that chapter of the NASCAR story tucked neatly inside thick black photo albums, home also to faded pictures of whiskey stills, war-ravaged German cities, and a sheet-draped corpse being loaded into a hearse.<br><br> The corpse had been Parks&#x2019;s cousin and stock car racing&#x2019;s first true star. He had been like a son to Parks. The day after his greatest racing victory, just as his sport was about to take off, he died. As usual, moonshine was to blame.<br><br> *<br><br> Except for Violet&#x2014;the most beautiful of his five wives, whom he married a decade ago at the age of eighty&#x2014;Parks is often alone now. He survived his previous wives and his lone son. He outlived all the racers whose careers he launched, including his friend and fellow war veteran Red Byron, who, despite a leg full of Japanese shrapnel, became NASCAR&#x2019;s first champion. He outlived Bill France, too, his wily friend who presided dictator-like over NASCAR&#x2019;s first quarter century. A handful of racers from the 1940s and &#x2019;50s are still kicking around, but none of the major players from those seminal, post-Depression days before there was a NASCAR. Even Dale Earnhardt, the man who brought NASCAR to the masses, is gone, killed at Daytona in 2001.<br><br> After abruptly leaving the sport in 1952, Parks watched in awe as NASCAR evolved into something that was unthinkable back in those uneasy years before and after World War II. In the late 1930s, at dusty red-dirt tracks, a victor would be lucky to take home $300 for a win&#x2014;if the promoter didn&#x2019;t run off with the purse. Now, a single NASCAR racing tire costs more than $300, and a win on any given Sunday is worth half a million.<br><br> Over the years, a few hard-core fans, amateur historians, or magazine writers have tracked Parks down. They stop by to scan his photographs, to tap into his memories of the rowdy races on red-clay tracks, the guns and women and fistfights and white liquor, the days before NASCAR existed. Most days, he works in his office alone, or with Violet by his side. He is the sole living keeper of NASCAR&#x2019;s true history, but his memory is fading, and Violet frets about that. In his tenth decade, Parks&#x2014;the ex-felon, the war veteran, the self- made millionaire and philanthropist&#x2014;has finally begun to slow down.<br> The &#x201c;sport&#x201d; that Parks helped create became a multibillion-dollar industry. It evolved from rural, workingman&#x2019;s domain into an attraction&#x2014;often an obsession&#x2014;for eighty million loyal fans. Today&#x2019;s NASCAR, still owned by a single family, is a phenomenon, a churning moneymaker&#x2014;equal parts Disney, Vegas, and Ringling Brothers&#x2014;and the second most popular sport in America, with races that regularly attract two hundred thousand spectators. No longer a second-tier event on ESPN2, races are now televised nationally on NBC, TNT, and FOX and in 2007 will begin airing on ABC, ESPN, and other networks, part of a TV contract worth nearly $5 billion.<br><br> With the help of sophisticated merchandising, marketing, and soaring corporate sponsorship, NASCAR continues growing beyond the South, faster than ever, becoming more mainstream by the day. NASCAR&#x2019;s red- white-and-blue logo is splashed on cereal boxes in supermarket aisles, on magazine covers, beer cans, clothing, even leather recliners. Try driving any major highway, even in the Northeast, without seeing NASCAR devotions glued to bumpers. Recent additions to the list of $20-million-a-year race car sponsors include Viagra and, reflective of NASCAR&#x2019;s growing female fan base, Brawny paper towels, Tide, and Betty Crocker. In a sign of NASCAR&#x2019;s relentless hunger for profit, it even rescinded a long-standing ban against liquor sponsors to allow Jack Daniels and Jim Beam to endorse cars in 2005.<br><br> In 2004, NASCAR&#x2019;s longtime top sponsor&#x2014;cigarette maker R. J. Reynolds, which had been introduced to NASCAR in 1972 by a convicted moonshiner&#x2014;was replaced by communications giant Nextel. That $750- million deal symbolized not only the sport&#x2019;s modern era but the continued decline of the South&#x2019;s ideological dominance of the sport. As Richard Petty has said, &#x201c;NASCAR is no longer a southern sport.&#x201d;<br><br> Today, NASCAR&#x2019;s fan base has found a happy home in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Dallas, Kansas City, and Chicago. Plans are even afoot for a racetrack near New York City. Most fans are college-educated, middle- aged, middle-class homeowners; nearly half are women. At a time when some pro baseball teams play before paltry crowds of a few thousand, attendance at NASCAR events grows by 10 percent a year. Average attendance at a NASCAR Nextel Cup race is nearly 200,000, three times bigger than the average NFL football game. The sport&#x2019;s stars are millionaire celebrities who appear in rock videos, date supermodels, and live in mansions. When Dale Earnhardt died, millions of Americans wept, as did Parks, who was there that day in 2001 when Earnhardt slammed into the wall at Daytona. The prolonged mourning for Earnhardt&#x2014;the sport&#x2019;s Elvis&#x2014;opened the eyes of more than a few non&#x2013;NASCAR fans.<br><br> As NASCAR&#x2019;s popularity continues to spread, the sport is becoming a symbol of America itself. But how did NASCAR happen at all? And why? The answers lie in the complicated, whiskey-soaked history of the South.<br><br> *<br><br> It&#x2019;s safe to say few of today&#x2019;s NASCAR fans know the name Raymond Parks, nor the monkey named Jocko, the busty pit-road groupies and brash female racers, the moonshining drivers named Fonty, Soapy, Speedy, Smokey, Cannonball, Jap, Cotton, Gober, and Crash. Nor the two intense, freckled friends named Red, one of whom came up with the name NASCAR&#x2014;the &#x201c;National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing&#x201d;&#x2014;and the other of whom became the sport&#x2019;s first champion. And its second.<br><br> Unlike baseball and football, which celebrate their pioneers and early heroes, most of the dirt-poor southerners who founded stock car racing have die...</p><h2>Sharing a Shell</h2><p><p>The tiny hermit crab loves his new shell.

In the midst of everything, he discovers that the land's thousand-year-old feud is based on betrayal and lies. Is there any hope for the queendom, or Han and Raisa's love? Chima has built a complex world filled with equally complex characters, living out an expertly structured and balanced plot in which everything that can go wrong does. Lovers of the series will dive in headlong to learn the fate of the people and lands they love, eating up the devious political machinations, the wizard magic, and bloody battles and will tear through the pages to see if true love wins. Newcomers, though, will be hopelessly lost, so only purchase where the series is popular. This fourth book in the Seven Realms series is recommended for lovers of political and action-laden fantasy, though scenes of violence and torture make it more appropriate for high school.-Melissa Moore. Set in an incredibly written fantasy world full of political turmoil, The Crimson Crown's gripping action scenes, coupled with forbidden romance, will immediately pull readers into Han and Raisa's captivating story. This stunning conclusion to the Seven Realms series takes readers on a fantastic ride through a country on the brink of both civil and international war, but whose people possess the most important emotion of all-hope. 5Q, 5P.-Camille Birch, Teen Reviewer. VOYA"<br><br>In this concluding volume of the series, wizard, thief, and now bodyguard Han Allister longs to marry his charge Queen Raisa, but she's committed to a political marriage to save her quarreling queendom. The "jinxflingers" hate the native Demonai clans, someone is murdering wizards in the slums (and Han is the prime suspect), and the Ardenine army hovers on the border, waiting for an excuse to invade. Only by playing the multiple schemers off one another to heal the country can Han hope to win Raisa's hand. Here the promise of previous volumes is realized: the budding love story springs to full flower and the hints captured in thousand-year-old legends are borne out, while the stakes are ratcheted up to perilous heights. Betrayal, war, and the faith of lovers all come around to a glorious conclusion as Chima weaves together her geopolitical, magical, romantic, and even mythical themes on an epic scale. anita l. burkam Horn Book"<br><br>Torture and treasure, treason and trust, and the triumph of true love: All come to fruition in the stirring conclusion to this epic fantasy series. Raisa ana'Marianna has claimed the Gray Wolf throne, but her grip is tenuous: Every faction-clans, wizards, army, flatlanders-both within and without the Fells hates all the others, and each pushes Raisa to accept its preferred candidate for consort. Meanwhile, Han Alister has taken his seat on the Wizard Council at the queen's command, but every other member secretly wants to use him or kill him. Furthermore, there are the mysterious murders of wizards, marked with Han's old streetlord sign; all this disarray signals a weakness that encourages invading armies from the South. Together, Han and Raisa seek the long-lost Armory of the Gifted Kings as the only way to avoid re-enacting a 1,000-year-old tragedy; but to wield such a weapon may well trigger an even greater catastrophe. Chima manages to resolve this impossibly tangled skein of politics, intrigue, history, prejudice and passion with style and grace. Grim scenes of shocking violence alternate with moments of tenderness and humor, and the high body count is balanced by the almost fairy-tale romantic conclusion. While some of the depth and complexities of the supporting characters-along with the nuanced subtleties of their conflicting worldviews-are sacrificed to help demonize (or valorize) their respective positions, nothing can overshadow the cathartic satisfaction for those caught up in this sweeping saga. Simply brilliant. Kirkus"</p><h2>The Tao of Love and Sex</h2><p>Two thousand years ago, at a time when the Christian West was frantically repressing sexuality, the Chinese were enjoying an erotic life that fused the sensual and the spiritual, in which sexual guilt and sexual aberrations like sadism and masochism were all but absent. This bestselling book by a leading modern exponent of Taoism makes that erotic life available to all who seek it. With its emphasis on male restraint and female pleasure and its healing vision of sex as an expression of a deeper cosmic balance, <b>The Tao of Love and Sex</b> offers us nothing less than a new model of loving, at once exciting and serene, passionate and compassionate.</p><p><b>Jolan Chang</b>&nbsp;(1917&#x2013;2002) was a Chinese-Canadian sexologist, Taoist philosopher, and author. He is known for&nbsp;<i>The Tao of Love and Sex: The Ancient Chinese Way to Ecstasy,&nbsp;<i>The Tao of the Loving Couple: True Liberation through the Tao</i></i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Food of Love and Sex: The Tao of Loving, Living and Eating</i>.</p><h2>Cooking With Fernet Branca</h2><p>Gerald Samper, an effete Englishman, lives on a hilltop in Tuscany. He is a ghostwriter for celebrities, and a foodie, whose weird tastes include &#39;Mussels in Chocolate and Garlic&#39; and &#39;Fernet Branca Ice Cream&#39;. His idyll is shattered by the arrival of Marta, a vulgar woman from a former Soviet republic now run by gangsters, notably male members of her family. She is a composer in a neo-folk style who claims to be writing a score for a trendy Italian film director. The neighbours&#39; lives disastrously intertwine. The entourages of the rock star and the director come and go; mysterious black helicopters bring news of mayhem in Voynova, Marta&#39;s homeland; and along the way the English obsession with Tuscany is satirized mercilessly. World rights for &#34;Cooking with Fernet Branca&#34; are controlled by Faber. Rights for Germany have already been sold.</p><p>James Hamilton-Paterson is the author of the bestselling Empire of the Clouds, which was hailed as a classic account of the golden age of British aviation. He won a Whitbread Prize for his first novel, Gerontius, and among his many other celebrated books are Seven-Tenths, one of the finest books written in recent times about the oceans, the satirical trilogy that began with Cooking with Fernet Branca, and the autobiographical Playing With Water. Born and educated in England, he has lived in the Philippines and Italy and now makes his home in Austria.If one were to imagine the house of fiction, the Serious Novel would be the front parlor, a showcase of antique furniture, with a few well-chosen prints on cream-colored walls and a Steinway baby grand in the corner (note the Chopin Etude artfully displayed on the keyboard stand). The large but unfinished basement, distinctly cluttered and prey to mildew, would be Mysteries, Romance Novels, Science Fiction and Fantasy. The small sun-room -- lots of glass, a good view of the sky and stars, some potted plants, a cat asleep in a ray of afternoon light -- could only be Poetry. <p>Cooking with Fernet Branca might look as though it belongs to the kitchen (the domain of Comfort Books -- a hodge-podge category embracing all kinds of writing about food and drink, some travel literature, many collections of letters and diaries). In fact, James Hamilton-Paterson's latest novel settles nicely into the playroom, for it is a silly, amusing and utterly inconsequential jeu d'esprit. There's nothing at all important to the book, aside from witty prose and a broad but affectionate lambasting of some recent cultural manias -- boy bands, UFOs, Tuscan villas, cooking, Do-It-Yourself projects, filmmaking, sports celebrities, the new Europe, gay tastefulness. It's really a summer treat at heart, and a good one to stash away for some bleak October evening.</p><p>Our story opens with Gerry Samper -- English, well-educated, reduced to ghostwriting the biographies of downhill skiers and race-car drivers -- ensconced in a small, isolated cottage high up a mountain overlooking the Mediterranean. He's in Le Roccie to finish his latest work-for-hire, contemplate his somewhat uncertain future and, most of all, indulge his passion for creative cookery. Gerry's tastes are, shall we say, gastronomically adventurous, though virtually all his dishes require anywhere from a teaspoon to a bottle of Fernet Branca (which Gerry himself downs like spring water even though it appears to possess the alcoholic kick of grappa or slivovitz). "Mussels in Chocolate," "Fish Cake," "Garlic Ice Cream" and "Baked Pears in Cheese Sauce" are among his favored delicacies, and he thoughtfully provides directions for their preparation, often adding a bit of personal commentary:</p><p>"Incidentally, this is the only recipe I know [for "Otter with Lobster Sauce"] that is associated with a curse. Two acquaintances who tried to make the dish died within the month, one in Buckinghamshire and the other in Somerset. By the quirkiest of mishaps both fell into rivers in spate and vanished into millraces. The cleric's body was found three weeks later, much disfigured. The drama teacher was never seen again. On enquiring I discovered that each had used commercial mayonnaise purchased in a supermarket for this recipe, so there is some justice in this world after all, even if a bit on the lenient side. Certainly the Bishop should have known better. No decent cook gets to heaven by way of Hellman's."</p><p>By the way, you are right to detect a slightly camp, swishy tone to Gerry's voice. He is what his neighbor Marta calls a "dudi." He even sings snippets of opera while preparing his wondrous dishes. Naturally, we are treated to brief descriptions of his most coloratura showpieces, including "Ennio's exhilarating aria 'Non disperdere nell'ambiente, cara,' from Lo stronzolo segreto. It's when Nedda is threatening to throw away the little flask of tears she has wept for him and he begs her not to. By all means the tears (he sings), for roses will spring up wherever they fall to earth; but not the antique Venetian bottle I bought for you. . . . This may, in fact, be the earliest example of environmentalism in opera."</p><p>His neighbor Marta? Alas, Gerry's unscrupulous real estate agent Benedetti misled him about the isolation of his little villa. An �migr� from the nation of Voynovia, newly liberated from the Soviet yoke, has moved into a similar hut quite nearby. In Gerry's eyes, Marta appears a semi-literate peasant, garbling broken English, constantly imbibing Fernet Branca. She is, in truth, a young composer and the eldest daughter of a great ancestral house, though her father has apparently served in the Soviet secret police and now oversees a mafia cell. Through a bit of luck, Marta has been invited to Italy to work on the score for a new film by the cult director Piero Pacini, best known for the saturnalian "Nero's Birthday."</p><p> But Marta, having grown up in a sheltered household, has never seen this film, nor any of Pacini's others. What's more, she is lonely for her sister and brother, for the sight of Mt. Sluszic, for the taste of kasha and shonka. We learn this through her letters home and through her own narration, which soon alternates with Gerry's. Neither artiste, it turns out, can believe that the other is anything more than a Fernet Branca-swilling dudi or a Fernet Branca-addicted slattern. And so the reader settles down to enjoy that ever fresh standby of light entertainment, the comedy of a couple who consistently misunderstand each other about almost everything. But, in this instance, especially about food: "I want to learn you all of Voynovia," says Marta to Gerry, "the fooding number one of all. Voynovian fooding best in all Europa, best in all of world. Is . . . mm."</p><p>This is the sort of English that Gerry hears, but in her own chapters, Marta writes perfectly grammatical sentences and is indeed quite an intellectual. She even has her doubts about those orgies that Pacini has inserted into a film supposedly about peaceful Green Party idealists, traditional fishermen and the legacy of fascism. Yet just as Marta soldiers on with her music, Gerry soon finds himself entertaining Brill, the leader of the world's most famous band (who wants the author of Downhill All the Way and Hot Seat! to write his biography). Before long, privies are destroyed and fences built, helicopters start to land regularly -- either piloted by Marta's criminal brother or bearing Pacini -- and film crews descend en masse, followed by Italian carabinieri. The humor grows funnier and, naturally, ever more tasteless: We learn that Brill was abused by druids, that Gerry wears trendy Homo Erectus jeans and once invented the LFM diet for a women's magazine ("Half a bottle of Fernet Branca a day, plus a single multivitamin pill and all the lard you can eat"), that vegetables have feelings, that Jane Austen wrote a novel called Donna and, not least, that "Jack Russells are absolute buggers to bone, notoriously so, but yield a delicate, almost silky p�t� that seems to welcome the careworn diner with both paws on the edge of the table, as it were." And lots, lots more. But don't even ask what an R rating stands for in Italy.</p><p>The wide-ranging James Hamilton-Paterson has published all sorts of books, from Gerontius, a Whitbread Award-winning novel about the composer Elgar, to a study of Ferdinand Marcos. His prose is always original and extremely winning, and he himself lives in Italy, to which, among other things, Cooking with Fernet Branca is a sly love letter. As Gerry says, when he joins Piero Pacini and company for lunch:</p><p>"A huge table is laid with buffet dishes from which we begin spearing and spooning liberal portions of this and that before seating ourselves with a large glass of white wine apiece. Be honest, who would live in England?"</p><p> Or in Washington? France maybe, though Italy is well-nigh irresistible. As is Cooking with Fernet Branca. </p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

In spite of a public perception that Eisenhower was unwilling to challenge McCarthy, Ike believed that directly confronting the senator would diminish the presidency. Therefore, the president operated with a &#x201c;hidden hand,&#x201d; refusing even to mention the Senator&#x2019;s name.<br> <br>In <i>Ike and McCarthy</i>, David A Nichols shows how the tension between the two men escalated. In a direct challenge to Eisenhower, McCarthy alleged that the US Army was harboring communists and launched an investigation. But the senator had unwittingly signed his own political death warrant. The White House employed surrogates to conduct a clandestine campaign against McCarthy and was not above using information about the private lives of McCarthy&#x2019;s aides as ammunition.<br> <br>In January 1954 McCarthy was arguably the most powerful member of the Senate. By the end of that year, he had been censured by his colleagues for unbecoming conduct. Eisenhower&#x2019;s covert operation had discredited the senator months earlier, exploiting the controversy that resulted from the televised Army-McCarthy hearings. McCarthy would never recover his lost prestige. Nichols uses documents previously unavailable or overlooked to authenticate the extraordinary story of Eisenhower&#x2019;s anti-McCarthy campaign. <i>Ike and McCarthy</i> is an eye-opening, newsworthy, and fascinating read.</p><p>David A. Nichols,&nbsp;a leading expert on the Eisenhower presidency, holds a PhD&nbsp;in&nbsp;history from the College of William and Mary.&nbsp;A former professor and academic dean at Southwestern College, he is the author of <i>A Matter of Justice: Eisenhower and the Beginning of the Civil Rights Revolution</i>;<i> Eisenhower 1956: The President&#x2019;s Year of Crisis</i>; and <i>Ike and McCarthy: Dwight Eisenhower&#x2019;s Secret Campaign against Joseph McCarthy</i>; as well as other books. He lives in Winfield, Kansas.Ike and McCarthy PREFACE<p></p> <br>Beginning in 1950, Wisconsin&#x2019;s junior senator, Joseph R. McCarthy, threw the United States into turmoil with his reckless, unsubstantiated charges that a variety of citizens, especially government employees, were Soviet agents. McCarthy&#x2019;s disregard for the truth, his insatiable appetite for headlines, and his willingness to damage reputations turned &#x201c;McCarthyism&#x201d; into an enduring epithet in our political language.<br> <br>Yet by the end of 1954, McCarthy&#x2019;s political influence had been essentially destroyed. How did that happen? The answer&#x2014;fully told for the first time in this book&#x2014;is that Dwight D. Eisenhower made it happen.<br> <br>Ironically, in 1953, due to Eisenhower&#x2019;s election, McCarthy acquired a new platform for his crusade. The Republicans held a one-vote majority in the Senate. As a result McCarthy was appointed chair of the Government Operations Committee and its permanent investigative subcommittee. In that capacity, the senator subpoenaed witnesses, conducted one-senator hearings, accused witnesses of guilt by association and labeled as &#x201c;obviously communist&#x201d; anyone who dared to invoke constitutional protections against self-incrimination.<br> <br>In 1953, the nation was still at war in Korea and recovering from the traumas of depression and World War II. The Cold War with the Soviet Union created a climate of fear that was the lifeblood of McCarthyism, especially the fear of subversion. But in January 1954, that began to change. McCarthy&#x2019;s prestige was at its zenith, with a Gallup Poll approval rating of 50 percent favorable, 29 percent unfavorable. But Eisenhower had concluded that the senator was more than a nuisance; he was a threat to the president&#x2019;s foreign policy goals, to his legislative program, and to his party&#x2019;s and his own electoral prospects.1<br> <br>So Eisenhower did something breathtaking and dangerous; he launched a clandestine operation designed to wrap a scandal around the neck of a prestigious US senator in the president&#x2019;s own party in an election year. That is what the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, lasting almost two months, were really about.2<br> THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM<p></p> <br>The standard explanations for McCarthy&#x2019;s political demise are well known: McCarthy, an alcoholic, did himself in; he was damaged by Edward R. Murrow&#x2019;s legendary See It Now television program; his reputation was tarnished by the unsympathetic glare of the television cameras and by his confrontation with the wily Boston attorney Joseph Nye Welch at the Army-McCarthy hearings. In this conventional version, the final nail in McCarthy&#x2019;s political coffin was the censure vote by the US Senate on December 2, 1954, which McCarthy lost 67 to 22.<br> <br>In recent years, pro-McCarthy revisionists have attempted to repair the senator&#x2019;s reputation by arguing that his political enemies destroyed him to cover up Soviet espionage in the US government. Eisenhower took the possibility of subversion seriously but firmly believed that his methods would be more effective and equitable than McCarthy&#x2019;s demagogic tactics.3<br> <br>In 1984, William Ewald published a book called Who Killed Joe McCarthy? Ewald drew on an immense cache of documents that Fred Seaton, the assistant secretary of defense, had collected on President Eisenhower&#x2019;s orders during the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings. Seaton possessed thousands of pages of letters, phone transcripts, memoranda, and documents that he had taken with him when he became secretary of the interior and&#x2014;when he left the government&#x2014;had hauled home to Nebraska. Ewald, who worked for Seaton at the Interior Department, recalled Seaton pointing to a locked file and saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never open that until you-know-who tells me to,&#x201d; referring to Eisenhower. When Seaton died, his &#x201c;Eyes Only&#x201d; file was donated to the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas, where I have reviewed virtually every page. In addition, I have had access to documents declassified since Ewald and other leading authors on McCarthy published their books in the 1980s.4<br> <br>Joseph McCarthy&#x2019;s senatorial correspondence has been sealed for the lifetime of his daughter. But my objective is to tell the Eisenhower story that has been so long neglected by historians.5<br> <br>This is a book about a particular era in US history&#x2014;a time when power brokers embraced attitudes and behaviors unacceptable today. Attitudes regarding race, gender, and homosexuality have changed but, in the 1950s, gays and their relationships were not just denigrated, they were openly persecuted. Just the rumor&#x2014;not the fact&#x2014;that a government official was homosexual could cost that person a job. Homosexuals were widely perceived to be security risks, subject to blackmail by communists. As the reader will discover, the Eisenhower administration reflected the prejudice and discriminatory practices of the era.<br> <br>This is a story about strategic deception, a realm in which Dwight Eisenhower was demonstrably expert. In 1944, the Allies under Supreme Commander Dwight Eisenhower successfully fooled the German leadership about when and where the largest military expeditionary force in human history would land in Europe. Operation Fortitude involved fake armies, dummy landing craft and airfields, fraudulent radio transmissions, and misleading leaks through diplomatic channels and double agents. Eisenhower understood that carefully planned, rigorously implemented deception could confuse an enemy until he makes a mistake; then he can be ambushed. That, politically, is what Eisenhower did to McCarthy. Only a half-dozen trusted aides knew what was really happening. Others&#x2014;including most of the era&#x2019;s great reporters&#x2014;missed the story.6<br> <br>Much of the conventional wisdom includes the enduring myth about the Eisenhower presidency&#x2014;that Ike was a disengaged, grandfatherly president more interested in playing golf than in the effective exercise of leadership. That legend&#x2014;now thoroughly discredited by two decades of intensive research&#x2014;was initially generated by historians who never forgave the popular general for defeating Adlai Stevenson in 1952. But in part, Ike was the author of his own myth. He was obsessive about protecting the Oval Office from anything controversial.<br> <br>In particular, critics grumble that Eisenhower failed to speak out about the great domestic issues of his time: civil rights and McCarthyism. His detractors depict him as downright cowardly in his response to the Red-baiting senator. Many would agree with the columnist Joseph Alsop, who, in 1954, after listening to an Eisenhower news conference statement intended to counter McCarthy, exclaimed, &#x201c;Why, the yellow son of a bitch!&#x201d;7<br> <br>Ike had not won the war in Europe by making speeches. He did not believe that presidential rhetoric would damage McCarthy. History shows that presidential oratory rarely results in historic change; transformative progress is most possible when a president, faced with a crisis, seizes the opportunity to exercise leadership; consider Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War or Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Great Depression. However, pundits persist in rating presidents for their skillful use of the &#x201c;bully pulpit.&#x201d;8<br> <br>Complaints that Eisenhower took too long to act against McCarthy are contrary to the facts. Any effort to destroy McCarthy during 1953 would probably have failed. There were eight to twelve senators who frequently supported McCarthy&#x2019;s positions on communist subversion; therefore, the president lacked an anti-McCarthy majority. Though Democrats supported the president on most foreign policy issues, leaders such as Lyndon B. Johnson delighted in treating McCarthy as &#x201c;a Republican problem.&#x201d;9<br> <br>President Harry Truman had openly denounced McCarthy for three years, but his attacks had only enhanced the senator&#x2019;s prestige; Ike ruined him in half that time. The Eisenhower operation against McCarthy in 1954 was not without its glitches. The general understood that in war or political conflict, a commander must constantly adjust a strategic mission to new realities. He often repeated the maxim &#x201c;Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.&#x201d;10<br> <br>In this case, the planning involved Eisenhower&#x2019;s rigorous delegation of operations to a half-dozen trusted subordinates. Those men were expected, like foot soldiers in a war, to put their lives and reputations on the line to protect the president and extinguish McCarthy&#x2019;s influence. Dwight Eisenhower&#x2019;s deceptive operation, mediated through his trusted lieutenants, &#x201c;killed&#x201d; Joe McCarthy.</p><h2>Heroes of Battle (Dungeons &amp; Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Rules Supplement)</h2><p><b>The essential handbook integrating war and battlefield action into D&amp;D� play.<br><br><i>Heros of Battle</i></b>&#x2122; provides everything one needs to know to play a battle-oriented <b>D&amp;D </b>campaign.

In this new Oxford history, a distinguished team of scholars presents an authoritative account of that story, richly illustrated, and based on the latest research.<br> Readers will learn how a collection of writings in Semitic languages and in Greek--writings that we now call the Books of the Bible--developed over a period of about 800 years and how, even before the Bible existed as one volume, its constituent parts were interpreted and subjected to a scrutiny that no other writing has had to endure. The contributors trace the routes by which the canon of Scripture was determined, shedding light on the many controversies over which writings should be regarded as authoritative and which should be considered Apocrypha and hidden from public use. They describe how over centuries the writings were copied, translated, and printed, and how they were interpreted in Judaism and in the churches in the East and West. It concludes with surveys of how the Bible is used today in feminist criticism, and in the movements for theological liberation in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. The volume also features an index and a guide to further reading. <br> Written by an international team of 17 renowned biblical scholars, and handsomely illustrated with over 150 black-and-white illustrations and 24 pages of color plates, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Bible</em> is an essential resource for everyone interested in the origin and interpretation of the Word of God.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Rogerson</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies, University of Sheffield, where he was Head of Department for 15 years. He is author of <em>An Introduction to the Bible, Atlas of the Bible, The Old Testament World</em> (with Philip Davies), and <em>Chronicle of the Old Testament Kings</em>.<br>This hugely ambitious book is intended to introduce every conceivable aspect of the history of the Bible, from its writing, preservation, and canonization to the historical interpretations and contemporary theology concerned with it, all in relatively short articles--a daunting task. Although plenty of gaps could be noted, the results overall are admirable. The two sections on the historical background and the creation of the Bible suffer from the typical flaws of generalized studies; there are plenty of tantalizing hypotheses, but no new information and little scholarly agreement are presented. The other two sections, however, concerned with the Bible's significance throughout history and contemporarily in feminism and liberation theology, provide rare detailed analysis of that historic significance and the many cultural revolutions it has inspired, including the invention of the printing press and Latin American social reform. Although new historical observations are not to be found in it, having so much information so copiously illustrated, albeit mostly in black-and-white, in one volume is gratifying. <i>John Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this immediate, thrilling, and inspiring memoir, Campbell recounts a timeless and transcendent tale of brotherhood, courage, and sacrifice.<br><br>As commander of a forty-man infantry platoon called Joker One, Campbell had just months to train and transform a ragtag group of brand-new Marines into a first-rate cohesive fighting unit, men who would become his family: Sergeant Leza, the house intellectual who read Che Guevara; Sergeant Mariano Noriel, the &#x201c;Filipino ball of fire&#x201d; who would become Campbell&#x2019;s closest confidant and friend; Lance Corporal William Feldmeir, a narcoleptic who fell asleep during battle; and a lieutenant known simply as &#x201c;the Ox,&#x201d; whose stubborn aggressiveness would be more curse than blessing. <br><br>Campbell and his men were assigned to Ramadi, that capital of the Sunni-dominated Anbar province that was an explosion just waiting to happen. And when it did happen&#x2013;with the chilling cries of &#x201c;Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!&#x201d; echoing from minaret to minaret&#x2013;Campbell and company were there to protect the innocent, battle the insurgents, and pick up the pieces. After seven months of day-to-day, house-to-house combat, nearly half of Campbell&#x2019;s platoon had been wounded, a casualty rate that went beyond that of any Marine or Army unit since Vietnam. Yet unlike Fallujah, Ramadi never fell to the enemy.<br><br>Told by the man who led the unit of hard-pressed Marines, <i>Joker One</i> is a gripping tale of a leadership, loyalty, faith, and camaraderie throughout the best and worst of times.</p><p>Donovan Campbell graduated with honors from Princeton University and Harvard Business School, finished first in his class at the Marines&#x2019; Basic Officer Course, and served three combat deployments&#x2013;two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon and a Bronze Star with Valor for his time in Iraq. He is now working for PepsiCo and living in Dallas, Texas, with his wife and daughter.<b>JOKER ONE<br><br>Chapter One<br><br></b>I found myself fascinated by the interesting geometric designs of the twisted iron rebar in front of me. For a time, my eyes traced each of the dark, thumb-thick strands where they spewed out of the cinder-block walls like the frozen tentacles of some monster from the myths of antiquity.<br><br>I have no idea how long I spent engrossed in contemplation, because time in and around firefights is somewhat fluid, but eventually I tore myself away from profound admiration of the destruction in front of my eyes. It was difficult, this return to a reality that sometimes seemed more like a myth&#x2014;or maybe a nightmare&#x2014;but it was necessary, because the problem immediately at hand was all too real. If I ignored it for too long, I might get everyone around me killed.<br><br>So I stepped back from the abandoned building&#x2019;s wall and surveyed the floor around me. Somewhere in the various piles of newly created rubble scattered about the floor were pieces of the rockets that had just ripped through two feet of cinder block to explode inside my observation post (OP). I needed to find at least one of these pieces, preferably the base of the warhead, because this was the first time that my unit had been hit by rockets capable of doing this much damage. If I could find a piece, then we could figure out what kind of rockets these were, estimate what it would take to launch them, and predict how they would be used in the future. We could then effectively plan to thwart them and potentially save several lives, which was important to me because my job description was twofold: 1) save lives and 2) take lives. Not necessarily in that order.<br><br>With these considerations in mind, I sifted diligently through the rubble until I found what I was looking for: a smooth black object, just a little larger than a hockey puck, with a half dozen or so holes drilled through it. Though the little puck looked fairly innocuous, I knew from hard-won experience that it was actually a thing of great pain; it was the base of one of the rockets that had just struck us. Without stopping to think, I grabbed the thick circular object as firmly as I could, shrieked manfully, and then dropped it as quickly as I could. Even ten minutes after its firing, this part of the explosive warhead was still hot enough to sear my palm. Important safety lesson: When picking up a newly fired enemy rocket warhead base, allow proper time for cooling <i>or </i>handle it with gloves. I filed that one away with other lessons learned the hard way, right after &#x201c;RPGs (rocket propelled grenades) that you need to worry about always make two booms&#x201d; and &#x201c;No one here is your friend.&#x201d; We now lived in a bizarre world where explosions were so commonplace that we had ways of distinguishing the more from the less harmful and where little tips and tricks about proper expended rocket handling made perfect sense to collate, absorb, and pass on. The absurd had become our baseline.<br><br>Ten minutes ago, though, the world was very simple, for it consisted solely of something that seemed like one gigantic explosion. Actually, it was three separate large explosions within half seconds of one another, but it&#x2019;s fairly difficult to make the distinction when you&#x2019;re lying on your back with your ears ringing. However, it&#x2019;s fairly easy to think rapidly and incoherently, which was exactly what I was doing as I lay on my back, wondering whether my hearing would return this time, and, incidentally, what in the hell had just happened to me and my men.<br><br>Time, I already knew, would answer the former question without any help from me, but as the lieutenant and the unit leader, it was my job to answer the latter one, and time in this case was working against me. If you&#x2019;re a Marine lieutenant in a firefight, a situation that&#x2019;s probably as good a proxy as any for hell, then it&#x2019;s your job to figure out at least 50 to 70 percent of what is going on around you so that you can make intelligent decisions, which translate into good orders, which lead to focused, effective, and decisive action. This whole process needs to be rapid to be relevant, but if you&#x2019;re too hasty, then you can lead your men to their deaths, all the while believing that you&#x2019;re leading them to safety. It&#x2019;s not an easy tension to manage on an ongoing basis.<br><br>However, it can be done, and to do it well you must have absolutely no concern for your own safety. You can&#x2019;t think of home, you can&#x2019;t miss your wife, and you can&#x2019;t wonder how it would feel to take a round through the neck. You can only pretend that you&#x2019;re already dead and thus free yourself up to focus on three things: 1) finding and killing the enemy, 2) communicating the situation and resulting actions to adjacent units and higher headquarters, and 3) triaging and treating your wounded. If you love your men, you naturally think about number three first, but if you do you&#x2019;re wrong. The grim logic of combat dictates that numbers one and two take precedence.<br><br>After the explosions, I rose, ears still ringing, and grabbed for the radio handset. Once the black handset was pressed firmly against my ear, I pushed the button with my thumb and, as calmly as I could manage, informed headquarters that my eleven men and I had just been hit by several large rockets. There were probably multiple casualties, I said, and maybe some of us were dead, but I didn&#x2019;t know just yet. I&#x2019;d call back. Headquarters squawked something in return, but, with my hearing still questionable and one of our machine guns firing full bore inside the all-concrete building, I couldn&#x2019;t understand a word, so I told HQ I&#x2019;d be back in touch when I could hear again. Then I put the handset down and resolutely ignored it until I could sort out what was going on inside the old abandoned hotel that my eleven-man squad and I were using as an observation position.<br><br>After five minutes of running helter-skelter through the thick dust that the rockets had kicked up, I found Sergeant Leza, my squad leader, and we conferred. Slowly the pieces of the attack came together to form a coherent picture: The massive explosion, which we assumed to be the rockets, had kicked off the insurgent assault. Seconds after their impact, one enemy from our southwest had fired an RPG at us but had missed, probably because one of my men had shot the insurgent as he took aim.<br><br>Simultaneously, several enemies off our southeast flank had sprayed the building with AK-47 fire, and the two Marines covering that sector had returned fire with their M-16s. They were unable to tell whether they had killed anyone. We had also taken some fire from our direct north and south, and the Marines in those positions, including my medium machine gunner, had reciprocated in spades. They, too, were unable to tell whether their return fire had had any effect. For the most part it was all pretty routine, with only two small deviations.<br><br>First off, directly across the street from our hotel, a car blazed furiously in an alleyway. I had seen burning cars before, but they were usually the result of either nearby bomb detonations or steady machine gun fire during particularly fierce combat. I had yet to see a burning car accompanied by a simultaneous rocket attack. I pushed the incongruity aside&#x2014;the more important question was how the enemy had managed to attack us with such powerful rockets, which were almost certainly antitank weapons and definitely not man-portable. Ten minutes later, my first squad, patrolling in<br>from the north, called in with an answer: The backseat of the burning car bore the clear remains of a homemade-rocket launcher, still smoldering inside. Our attackers had simply parked the vehicle in an inconspicuous place next to the gates of a house, hoping that we would lose track of the nondescript vehicle amid the hustle and bustle of the thriving marketplace area below us. When the rest of the assault was ready, a spotter within the crowd had launched the rockets with a cellphone call.<br><br>The second small plot twist, however, was that no United States Marines were wounded or killed in this story, a very unusual thing for a Ramadi day in August 2004. In spite of their clever plan and their disciplined execution, our enemies had failed&#x2014;we hadn&#x2019;t stopped our mission for even a second. Indeed, we had probably winged at least one of our attackers, although it&#x2019;s sometimes difficult to tell because most people don&#x2019;t go down when you shoot them with our little .223 bullets. So on that day, I believed that God had been watching over us. Up to that point, even with the horrors I had witnessed,<br><br>I retained my faith, if only barely. Every time events made me ready to throw in the towel, a small miracle happened&#x2014;like antitank rockets missing our floor&#x2014;or I saw something supernaturally beautiful in the actions of one of my Marines, and for one more day, it was enough to keep faith and hope alive.<br>Now, nearly three years after that August day, those Marines and I have long since parted ways. Our time together in Iraq seems like someone else&#x2019;s story, for there&#x2019;s nothing in America even remotely similar to what we experienced overseas, nothing that reminds us of what we suffered and achieved together. And none of us have really been able to tell that story, not fully, not even to our families, because each small telling takes a personal toll. No one wants to suffer the pain of trying to explain the unexplainable to those who rarely have either the time or the desire to comprehend. So, many of us have simply packed our war away and tried hard to fit into normalcy by ignoring that time in our lives.<br><br>But our story is an important one, and I believe that it&#x2019;s worth telling truthfully and completely no matter what the cost. For seven and a half months, from March to September 2004, my company of 120 Marines battled day in and day out against thousands of enemy fighters in a city that eventually earned the title of Iraq&#x8;...</p><h2>African Ceremonies</h2><p>A stirring illustrated celebration of the vanishing tribal traditions of the African continent documents a wide range of ceremonies in words and pictures, including baby namings, initiations, weddings, harvest blessings, coronations, healing exorcisms, and funerals, among many others.</p><p>By a recent count, the continent of Africa comprises some 1,300 cultures. Some of them number millions of people, some only a few families; some are thriving, while others are in danger of disappearing, the victims of acculturation or, in extreme cases, of genocide. This diversity--and the dangers to it--is little known outside Africa. Photographers Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher highlight both matters in <i>African Ceremonies</i>, an extraordinary two-volume collection of some 850 full-color images. The two artists have traveled to almost all the continent's 53 countries in the last three decades, documenting traditional tribal life in earlier books and articles for <i>National Geographic</i>, among other publications. Here they focus on the religious customs of several dozen peoples, combining stunning images with well-written essays to illustrate the enduring power of traditional beliefs.<p> Among the book's finest moments are a record of the Fulani cattle crossing, when for 10 days young males drive their herds across the wide Niger River to receive gifts from their grateful compatriots; a sequence showing a healing ceremony of the Himba people of Namibia and Angola, whose "wild women," possessed by lion spirits, are riveting actors on the page; and a remarkable series of photographs of Wodaabe courtship dancers, who compete to attract wives by charming them with exaggerated smiles and the skilled use of cosmetics. The authors note that, as women, they entered places men never could--and as foreigners, they were also often welcomed as "honorary males" and allowed to witness male-only ceremonies. Many of these rites are in danger of extinction as old ways are forgotten and in some cases suppressed. Beckwith and Fisher have captured them before it's too late. Beautifully designed and manufactured, <i>African Ceremonies</i> makes a fine companion to Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s <i>Wonders of the African World</i>, and invites leisurely reading--and constant revisiting. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>In four previous books, acclaimed photographers Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher have documented vanishing tribal customs in Africa-and won an enormous following. Now, after nearly a decade of travel and research, they have created their masterwork-a monumental two-volume exploration of traditional African rites and rituals. Spanning the continent, Beckwith and Fisher open our eyes to scores of exotic and wondrous ceremonies-baby namings, initiations, weddings, harvest blessings, coronations, healing exorcisms, and funerals, among others. Many of these rituals will never be performed again; few have been pictured and described with the intimacy, knowledge, and skill of Beckwith and Fisher. Overflowing with nearly 850 magnificent color photographs, African Ceremonies is one of the most important works on Africa ever published. Two volumes, slipcased. 847 photographs in full color, 45 maps, 1011/4 x 1377/8&#34; Subsidiary Rights: Selected by Book-of-the-Month Club Carol Beckwith And Angela Fisher, who collaborated on Abrams&#39; African Ark, have been photo graph ing in Africa for 30 years.

Perio dicals such as National Geographic, Time, LIFE, People, The New York Times, and many others have reported on their achievements and featured their photographs.

Josie is especially excited this year-Ian Bennington, a recently discovered distant relative, will be joining the fun. Both Ian and Josie are, it seems, descended from Arabella Churchill, a 17th century royal mistress. The party is a success and Ian is a hit. It gives Josie an unexpected thrill to have family-and unexpected dread when he vanishes.</p><p>Ian doesn't keep his dinner date with Josie's good friend, Lavinia, or his lunch date with her. Surely, he would have done so-if he could. Ian has given his daughter two priceless 17th century watercolor miniature portraits, one of Arabella and one of her lover, King James II, and they've gone missing, too. Knowing that after her nasty divorce, Lavinia is facing financial ruin, Josie can't help wondering if her friend is behind the theft-and Ian's disappearance.</p><p>Determined to find Ian, Josie uses her knowledge of antiques to track the miniatures. In doing so, she learns the true meaning of Christmas-and the true meaning of family.

F. Skinner, an American behavioral psychologist, is known for his many contributions to learning theory. His Behavior of Organisms (1938) reports his experiments with the study of reflexes. Walden Two (1949), a utopian novel, describes a planned community in which positive rather than negative reinforcers serve to maintain appropriate behavior; the novel stimulated the founding of some experimental communities. In Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1971), Skinner attempted to show that only what he called a technology of behavior could save democracy from the many individual and social problems that plague it. (An early example of this technology is the so-called Skinner box for conditioning a human child.) A teacher at Harvard University from 1948 until his retirement, Skinner was for some the model of the objective scientist, for others the epitome of the heartless behaviorist who would turn people into automatons.</p><h2>Steeling the Mind of America: Hal Lindsey, John Anderberg, Henry Morris, Chuck Missler, Don McAlvany</h2><p>This book is being called &#34;the most important conservative American information compiled in the last 20 years&#34;, and contains detailed &#34;inside information&#34; on where we&#39;re headed as individuals, as a nation and as a world.

With his signature mix of intelligence and highly literate snark, he dives headlong into contemporary crises--Hurricane Katrina, the Sudanese civil war--through the lens of a single character whose perspective we get to know intimately. In his new novel, Eggers tackles a modern problem that doesn't always seem like one: our near constant hunger for communication. When Mae Holland takes a job at the Circle, a tech giant with a utopian culture and cultlike following (Eggers didn't call it Schmoogle, but may as well have), she quickly loses sight of her friends, family, and sense of self in favor of professional success and social acceptance. As her Circle star rises, Mae succumbs to the corporate code of full disclosure, eventually agreeing to "go transparent" and let the public watch--and comment on--her every move. "Privacy is theft," decrees the company motto; "Secrets are lies." It's not subtle, but neither were "Harrison Bergeron" and <em>1984</em>, and in its best moments <em>The Circle</em> is equally terrifying. Let's just hope it's not prescient. --<em>Mia Lipman</em>Dave Eggers grew up near Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In this book--the companion volume to a traveling retrospective--the full flower of Parks's genius is both awe-inspiring in its depth and thorough in its demolition of the era's social-science fictions about African American potential.<p> Born in Kansas, Parks wandered as a homeless teen, and through wit, smarts, and improvisation--and no experience--landed a job as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration, then with his new skill took pictures for <i>Life</i> magazine. "Tyrants, dictators, dethroned kings," he writes, "all stared into my camera with eyes that were unveiled. The camera revealed them as they were--human beings imprisoned inside themselves." Highlights among his photographic work include the haunting shot of domestic Ella Watson, the starkness of a 1940s teenaged gang leader named Red Jackson lying eternally young in his coffin, and the elegant, life-and-death ballet of the Spanish bullfight. Parks's depiction of Duke Ellington's towering music in motion reflects the importance of jazz and blues in Parks's artistry. From the films <i>Shaft</i> and <i>The Learning Tree</i> (the latter adapted from his own novel) to his impressionistic ballet honoring Martin Luther King Jr., his work swings with an American rhythm that continues to inspire him. "A musical theme vibrates in my sleep," he writes. "I get up, go to the piano, and jot it down. A blustery sky, a crescent moon, or the blazing sun can hurry me to poetry, or to the camera. When the doors of promise open, the trick is to quickly walk through them." <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>Gordon Parks, at age 84, is truly a living legend - one of the early Life photographers, and among the most esteemed photographers of our time. His career also extends well beyond the camera - he is an acclaimed poet, filmmaker and composer, and author of many books, from The Learning Tree (1963) to Voices in the Mirror (1990), Arias in Silence (1994), and Glimpses Toward Infinity (1996).</p><h2>Ripley Under Water</h2><p>Tom Ripley passes his leisured days at his French country estate tending the dahlias, practicing the harpsichord, and enjoying the company of his lovely wife, Heloise.

When menacing coincidences begin to occur, a spiraling contest of sinister hints and mutual terrorism ensues, resulting in one of Patricia Highsmith's most elegantly harrowing novels to date.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>For more than four decades, Patricia Highsmith has developed her unique mastery of suspense - not least in her renowned cycle of novels featuring Tom Ripley. Now, with the fifth in that series and her first new novel in five years, she demonstrates yet again her ability, as Graham Greene wrote, &#34;to create a world of her own, a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger&#34;. Though his talent for evil has in no way diminished, Tom Ripley has aged, even mellowed. Now leading the good life in the French countryside, complete with chic wife and devoted housekeeper, he is more interested in his wine stores than the bloodstains on the cellar floor. Then a meddlesome American couple takes up residence in the same village. Though at first the Pritchards seem a mere curiosity, their taste as execrable as their manners, they are annoyingly well informed about incidents in Ripley&#39;s past and almost smug about flaunting their knowledge. This, of course, disturbs the tranquillity of the charmed, cultured life for which Tom has worked so hard, and he has no choice but to bedevil the Pritchards in return. Thus begins a spirited, sophisticated game of cat and mouse that leads to Tangier and London and back again, to the pond behind the Pritchards&#39; house. It is Ripley at his most suave and devious - and Patricia Highsmith in peak form. For her aficionados, Ripley Under Water is utterly essential - and for readers new to her work, a spectacular introduction to &#34;a natural novelist&#34; (John Gross, The New York Times).Patricia Highsmith (1921 &#x2013; 1995) was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and grew up in New York. She was educated at the Julia Richmond High School in Manhattan and then at Columbia University, where she earned her B.A. in 1942. Her first novel, <b>Strangers on a Train</b> (1950), tells the story of a tennis player and a psychotic who meet on a train and agree to swap murders. The terrifying tale caught the attention of director Alfred Hitchcock, who, with Raymond Chandler, filmed it in 1951. Both the book and the resulting movie are considered to be classics of the crime genre. Highsmith&#x2019;s subsequent novels, particularly five featuring the dashing forger/murderer Tom Ripley, have been vastly popular and critically acclaimed. In 1957 Highsmith won the coveted French Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere and in 1964 was awarded the Silver Dagger by the British Crime Writers Association. A reclusive person, Highsmith spent much of her life alone. She moved permanently to Europe in 1963 and spent her final years in an isolated house near Locarno on the Swiss-Italian border. Upon her death, Highsmith left three million dollars of her estate to Yaddo, the artist community in upstate New York.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The PEN/O.

We hope that if we could pinpoint the real beginning of a story, it would reveal all that a story holds&#x2014;certain aspects of the author&#x2019;s personal history; the experience, fact, or image that caught the author&#x2019;s imagination; the path through language from imagination to a coherent work of art. We wish to be able to extrapolate the mysterious process of writing fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many stories draw upon either the experience of the writer or another&#x2019;s experience as reported to the writer. This is not an assertion that every story is autobiographical (or biographical), only that something of the writer&#x2019;s own life is of necessity part of every story. A number of writers find their stories through research, a method of educating oneself and also of procrastinating. For still other stories, and other writers, the inspiration may be as fleeting as a landscape glimpsed from a passing train.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the process of writing always remains mysterious. There can be no definitive answer to a question about a story&#x2019;s origin because the best stories are manifold and open to multiple understandings. A single origin doesn&#x2019;t seem enough for the stories we love and reread. Furthermore, a story presents changed meanings over time to a faithful reader, for the story we read in middle age is different from the one we first encountered in adolescence. A single glance from a train doesn&#x2019;t account for a story&#x2019;s beginning&#x2014;it&#x2019;s too monocular, too limited&#x2014;and yet that may be the way the story&#x2019;s creator remembers it. A story undergoes many changes as it&#x2019;s written, making it a complicated journey from the starting point. <br> &nbsp;<br> We do want to know where a story came from, and by that we mean the whole story, not only the tiny flash that began the imaginative process. Implicit in the question is the respect we have for the story, and the answer we suspect: Not even the writer really knows where the story came from. If that were known, why bother to write?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> John Berger&#x2019;s &#x201c;A Brush&#x201d; epitomizes a kind of silence I associate with the short-story form. In the story, the reader finds a slow, almost offhand perception that presents itself when one is looking the other way, or, as W. H. Auden said in &#x201c;Mus�e des Beaux Arts,&#x201d; &#x201c;While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along.&#x201d;<br><br> We are all self-preoccupied; the narrator of &#x201c;A Brush&#x201d; is no exception. In Paris, he makes his way through his routine, giving no evidence that he is either lonely or happy in his solitude. We experience what he wants us to&#x2014;chance meetings, a slow revelation of character and history by those he notices, and, finally, the shock of understanding, a moment of real attention. In the story&#x2019;s ending, we understand how much the narrator has come to value and gain from his urban friendship. The narrator of &#x201c;A Brush&#x201d; is both the reader&#x2019;s informant and a character involved in the story&#x2019;s action. Berger&#x2019;s masterly writing conveys with equal grace the recent history of Cambodia and the patient skill required in making art. At the story&#x2019;s simple and exquisite ending, the narrator summons both fact and feeling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Salvatore Scibona&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Woman Who Lived in the House&#x201d; has an eccentric and delightful ending. The story is about many varieties of togetherness. �smundur Gudmundsson has a few easy relationships&#x2014;with his father-in-law, and with a sister and niece&#x2014;and several complicated ones&#x2014;with a dog who&#x2019;s crazy about him, an unsuitable lover, and his disgruntled wife. Scibona throws us right into the story with the announcement from a television set that �smundur&#x2019;s latest investment, the one he and his wife put everything into, has failed. In no time at all, the marriage follows suit, in �smundur&#x2019;s determination an act of God, who, &#x201c;after twenty years of giving them the stamina and will that makes young Eros turn into the companionship of married love,&#x201d; ends it in a comical street accident. The whole story is a dance of attachment and separation, connection and alienation, and, finally, of love lost and love renascent. The ending is both a surprise and a joy; the one we didn&#x2019;t know we were waiting for at last is back with us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anthony Doerr was included in <i>The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories</i> in 2002, 2003, 2008, and now appears, for a fourth time, with &#x201c;The Deep,&#x201d; a story that combines the author&#x2019;s preoccupations first with the natural world as it is seen through science and then with the interior, often secret, lives of his characters. In the case of &#x201c;The Deep,&#x201d; Tom&#x2019;s interior life is dominated by his heart, a defective organ: &#x201c;Atrial septal defect. Hole in the heart. The doctor says blood sloshes from the left side to the right side. His heart will have to do three times the work. Life span of sixteen. Eighteen if he&#x2019;s lucky. Best if he doesn&#x2019;t get excited.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice of science&#x2014;and Tom&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;urges extreme caution. Tom&#x2019;s spirit looks at those small numbers&#x2014;sixteen, eighteen&#x2014;and wonders how cautious can he be and live. Tom&#x2019;s heart keeps him slow, careful, and quiet. His life is different from that of the other children, particularly other boys. The tension in the story is between the restrictions imposed by his literal organ and the desires of Tom&#x2019;s metaphorical heart. <br> &nbsp;<br> In Lauren Groff &#x2019;s &#x201c;Eyewall,&#x201d; a hurricane rages outside and inside the narrator&#x2019;s three-hundred-year-old house, flinging this way and that her chickens, furnishings, books, and her past. For all that is destroyed, something whole and new is created by the rollicking lively narrator. Groff &#x2019;s story is poetical and laced with humor, as the dead drink excellent wine with the living, and the storm rocks on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christine Sneed&#x2019;s &#x201c;The First Wife&#x201d; narrates a story about inevitability in a doomed relationship, a kind of wry love letter from the cautious, somber narrator to her beautiful, unfaithful, and predictable husband. The story is a consideration of a clich�&#x2014;the handsome movie star&#x2019;s infidelity. A reader might well ask the star&#x2019;s wife: Why is it that we go on asking questions to which we know the answer, starting things we know will end in failure? The answer is what Jean Rhys called &#x201c;Hope, the vulture,&#x201d; and because<br> it feels good to bet against the odds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Often the ending of a short story brings a reversal of fortune, character, or the expectations established at the start. In Sam Ruddick&#x2019;s well-choreographed &#x201c;Leak,&#x201d; there&#x2019;s a comical reversal. A man believes he&#x2019;s having a straightforward and, for all parties, satisfactory adulterous affair. Before long, it&#x2019;s clear that he&#x2019;s the innocent in the crowd that gathers, like clowns exploding from a car, at his assignation. The story&#x2019;s title is a definition of what happens in every aspect of this lover&#x2019;s duet, trio&#x2014;no, quartet. Ruddick has a gift for understatement and for moving his characters along in ways that surprise and delight the reader.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s often said that in marriage one partner is the brakes and the other the gas. In Alice Mattison&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Vandercook,&#x201d; the narrator is the caboose and his wife the engine. When the narrator, his wife, and children move across the country to the narrator&#x2019;s hometown to aid his aging father and keep the family business going, the marriage&#x2019;s balance of power and love is fatally disturbed. The narrator&#x2019;s calm, rational voice doesn&#x2019;t conceal the pain of a new understanding of his past and consideration of his future. By the end of the story what was whole seems corrupted. The beauty of the story lies in its sense of the continuity of the lives narrated. The characters will go on, but with a telling difference. Mattison&#x2019;s story will be read and reread to trace the narrator&#x2019;s understanding of his wife&#x2019;s character and his own.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dagoberto Gilb&#x2019;s moving story &#x201c;Uncle Rock&#x201d; narrates a similar movement toward understanding, though in the case of Erick, whose difficult, compromised childhood is explored, there&#x2019;s freedom rather than disillusionment in the end. Confronting cruelty, Erick gains a new understanding of his mother, of masculinity, and of his own strength. The boy who doesn&#x2019;t speak in either of his languages ends the story with an evasion that protects both his imperfect mother and her lover. By speaking, Erick steps toward adulthood. He sees what he didn&#x2019;t wish to, understands the unintended consequences of lush, powerless female beauty and male power, and moves into his own complicated life.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Kevin Wilson&#x2019;s &#x201c;A Birth in the Woods,&#x201d; the mixture of realism and fantasy pushes the reader into a nightmare. A young boy&#x2019;s parents isolate themselves in the joyful, arrogant belief that they can make a new Eden and raise their child in a utopia. The story&#x2019;s narration of a mother&#x2019;s love, and her manipulation of her weak husband and young son, mixes with the elements of horror. The blood announced at the beginning of the story covers the family by the end. Wilson&#x2019;s story is most brilliant in capturing the innocent ignorance of the child and the ways in which every child is a victim of his parents&#x2019; choices.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cath in Keith Ridgway&#x2019;s &#x201c;Rothko Eggs&#x201d; lives in London with her mother. Cath&#x2019;s parents are divorced, and she feels like their caretaker, more knowledgeable about them than they are about themselves. She loves art and thinks about it, but just as often thinks about how to think about it. The story&#x2019;s diction is striking; simple sentences, repeated, varied, until there&#x2019;s a pileup, a fender bender of thoughts and words. The narration is a close-up third person, so close that we are nearly in Cath&#x2019;smind as she puzzles out matters of art and sex, and, oddest of all, her parents&#x2019; shared history before she was born. Cath is central to them, but, she finds, only part of their relationship and not the whole of it, as she once thought. Ridgway&#x2019;s story plays with articulating inarticulateness. For Cath, an intelligent and sensitive young woman, the impossibility of describing abstract art is nothing next to the impenetrability of other people&#x2019;s motives and emotions, and her own. <br> &nbsp;<br> As in Kevin Wilson&#x2019;s and Keith Ridgway&#x2019;s stories, Hisham Matar&#x2019;s &#x201c;Naima&#x201d; has at its core a child trying to accommodate himself to his parents&#x2019; choices and secrets. &#x201c;You need adulthood to appreciate such horror,&#x201d; the narrator tells us. A useful question when reading first-person stories is, <i>Why is the narrator telling this story?</i> A general answer is, <i>To understand what happened.</i> In the case of &#x201c;Naima,&#x201d; the narrator is trying to understand his parents&#x2019; marriage, his mother&#x2019;s death, and the place in his life of Naima, the family&#x2019;s servant. His parents so overshadow Naima that the reader also initially wonders why the story is named for Naima rather than the mother or father. The beauty of Matar&#x2019;s story lies in the narrator&#x2019;s delicacy as he seeks to slice through memory without destroying the past.<br> &nbsp;<br> Adulthood doesn&#x2019;t much benefit the narrator of Ann Packer&#x2019;s &#x201c;Things Said or Done,&#x201d; nor does the wry humor with which she copes with her father&#x2019;s egomania and hypochondria. &#x201c;Other people throw parties; my father throws emergencies. It&#x2019;s been like this forever. When I was a kid I thought the difference between my father and other parents was that my father was more fun. It took me years to see it clearly. My father was a rabble-rouser. He was fun like a cyclone.&#x201d; And then there is the narrator&#x2019;s mother, a model of distanced cool, an escaped prisoner who refuses to risk her freedom to help her daughter. If the father were all monstrous, the story wouldn&#x2019;t be as good as it is, nor would the narrator be as sympathetic a victim of herself and her family. The story&#x2019;s intertwined characters are testimony that there are no easy answers for those trapped by love and loyalty.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the second year in a row, fiction by Mark Slouka and Jim Shepard is included in <i>The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> Last year&#x2019;s story by Mark Slouka was about an estranged father taking a terrible chance with his young son; this year&#x2019;s story is also about a father and son. In &#x201c;The Hare&#x2019;s Mask,&#x201d; the narrator begins by announcing how much he misses his beloved father, then goes on to tell a complicated tale of himself as a boy trying to imagine himself into his father&#x2019;s past. Something primitive is stirred as the narrator realizes that the world existed before he did. He pieces together a terrible loss his own father suffered at his age. The narrator tells us he had a &#x201c;precocious ear for loss&#x201d; and &#x201c;misheard almost everything.&#x201d; In this brief, layered, beautifully told story, the narrator moves from a child&#x2019;s innocent inability to comprehend the past&#x2019;s sorrows to an adult&#x2019;s wonder that human beings dare to risk such pain again.<br> &nbsp;<br> The narrator of Jim Shepard&#x2019;s powerful &#x201c;Boys Town&#x201d; lacks, among other things, the capacity to weather loss and sorrow. His mother is a foulmouthed bully, and he is incapable of freeing himself from her. &#x201c;Boys Town&#x201d; is the story of a person without resources, internal or external, who has neither the education nor the emotional means to grow beyond his limiting circumstances. When he looks outside of himself at a movie seen long ago, he sees a hero who has nothing to offer but empty promises.&#x201c;Most people don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like to look down the road and see there&#x2019;s nothing there. You try to tell somebody that, but they just look at you.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The hero/narrator of &#x201c;East of the West&#x201d; by Miroslav Penkov is named Nose for his &#x201c;ugly snoot,&#x201d; the result of his cousin Vera&#x2019;s punch, which crushed &#x201c;it like a plain biscuit.&#x201d; In other ways, too, Nose is broken into pieces by Vera. &#x201c;East of the West&#x201d; centers on the river that divides Nose from his cousin, as it divides Serbia from Bulgaria. The river brings tragedy and heartbreak. The river covers the past, and Nose gathers his courage and swims to a drowned church with his cousin. The question of identity&#x2014;who&#x2019;s a Serb? who&#x2019;s a Bulgarian?&#x2014;rides through the story and becomes a larger question: <i>Who will dare to change?</i> When you finish reading some stories you feel you&#x2019;ve listened to a song. Miroslav Penkov&#x2019;s &#x201c;East of the West&#x201d; is such a story.<br> &nbsp;<br> The main character in &#x201c;Mickey Mouse&#x201d; by Karl Taro Greenfeld is a Japanese artist in wartime Tokyo assigned the task of creating a cartoon character to represent his country and displace the globally popular American rodent. The atmosphere of war, survival, and danger is so skillfully created by Greenfeld that it isn&#x2019;t until the end of the story that the reader understands what the artist hasn&#x2019;t about his peculiar and impossible assignment.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steven Millhauser&#x2019;s &#x201c;Phantoms&#x201d; is about the memory of a whole community as it lives with its all-too-present past. The phantoms, or ghosts, appear and reappear, a continuity after death that brings little comfort to the living. The presence of the past creates problems for the parents of the town: to tell or not to tell? What frightens a child more&#x2014;ignorance or knowledge? Humorous, wise, and smart, the first-person-plural narrative covers the life of the haunted town and its people, making its consciousness of its phantoms and its willful forgetfulness seem more or less like our own relationships with our own ghosts....</p><h2>Deep-Sea Dash</h2><p>Eccentric billionaire Warren Wheelie Wheelnut has decided to mount the biggest, maddest, most off-the scale competition ever!

His debut, Killing Floor, won both the Anthony and the Barry Awards for Best First Mystery. Foreign rights in the Jack Reacher series have sold in thirty-nine territories. Child, a native of England and former television writer, lives in New York City, where he is at work on his eleventh Jack Reacher thriller.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>JACK REACHER ORDERED espresso, double, no peel, no cube, foam cup, no china, and before it arrived at his table he saw a man's life change forever. Not that the waiter was slow. Just that the move was slick. So slick, Reacher had no idea what he was watching. It was just an urban scene, repeated everywhere in the world a billion times a day: A guy unlocked a car and got in and drove away. That was all.<br><br>But that was enough.<br><br>The espresso had been close to perfect, so Reacher went back to the same cafe&#x17d; exactly -twenty--four hours later. Two nights in the same place was unusual for Reacher, but he figured great coffee was worth a change in his routine. The caf� was on the west side of Sixth Avenue in New York City, in the middle of the block between Bleecker and Houston. It occupied the ground floor of an undistinguished -four--story building. The upper stories looked like anonymous rental apartments. The cafe itself looked like a transplant from a back street in Rome. Inside it had low light and scarred wooden walls and a dented chrome machine as hot and long as a locomotive, and a counter. Outside there was a single line of metal tables on the sidewalk behind a low canvas screen. Reacher took the same end table he had used the night before and chose the same seat. He stretched out and got comfortable and tipped his chair up on two legs. That put his back against the cafe's outside wall and left him looking east, across the sidewalk and the width of the avenue. He liked to sit outside in the summer, in New York City. Especially at night. He liked the electric darkness and the hot dirty air and the blasts of noise and traffic and the manic barking sirens and the crush of people. It helped a lonely man feel connected and isolated both at the same time.<br><br>He was served by the same waiter as the night before and ordered the same drink, double espresso in a foam cup, no sugar, no spoon. He paid for it as soon as it arrived and left his change on the table. That way he could leave exactly when he wanted to without insulting the waiter or bilking the owner or stealing the china. Reacher always arranged the smallest details in his life so he could move on at a split second's notice. It was an obsessive habit. He owned nothing and carried nothing. Physically he was a big man, but he cast a small shadow and left very little in his wake.<br><br>He drank his coffee slowly and felt the night heat come up off the sidewalk. He watched cars and people. Watched taxis flow north and garbage trucks pause at the curbs. Saw knots of strange young people heading for clubs. Watched girls who had once been boys totter south. Saw a blue German sedan park on the block. Watched a compact man in a gray suit get out and walk north. Watched him thread between two sidewalk tables and head inside to where the cafe staff was clustered in back. Watched him ask them questions.<br><br>The guy was medium height, not young, not old, too solid to be called wiry, too slight to be called heavy. His hair was gray at the temples and cut short and neat. He kept himself balanced on the balls of his feet. His mouth didn't move much as he talked. But his eyes did. They flicked left and right tirelessly. The guy was about forty, Reacher guessed, and furthermore Reacher guessed he had gotten to be about forty by staying relentlessly aware of everything that was happening around him. Reacher had seen the same look in elite infantry veterans who had survived long jungle tours.<br><br>Then Reacher's waiter turned suddenly and pointed straight at him. The compact man in the gray suit stared over. Reacher stared back, over his shoulder, through the window. Eye contact was made. Without breaking it the man in the suit mouthed <i>thank you</i> to the waiter and started back out the way he had entered. He stepped through the door and made a right inside the low canvas screen and threaded his way down to Reacher's table. Reacher let him stand there mute for a moment while he made up his mind. Then he said "Yes," to him, like an answer, not a question.<br><br>"Yes what?" the guy said back.<br><br>"Yes whatever," Reacher said. "Yes I'm having a pleasant evening, yes you can join me, yes you can ask me whatever it is you want to ask me."<br><br>The guy scraped a chair out and sat down, his back to the river of traffic, blocking Reacher's view.<br><br>"Actually I do have a question," he said.<br><br>"I know," Reacher said. "About last night."<br><br>"How did you know that?" The guy's voice was low and quiet and his accent was flat and clipped and British.<br><br>"The waiter pointed me out," Reacher said. "And the only thing that distinguishes me from his other customers is that I was here last night and they weren't."<br><br>"You're certain about that?"<br><br>"Turn your head away," Reacher said. "Watch the traffic."<br><br>The guy turned his head away. Watched the traffic.<br><br>"Now tell me what I'm wearing," Reacher said.<br><br>"Green shirt," the British guy said. "Cotton, baggy, cheap, doesn't look new, sleeves rolled to the elbow, over a green T-shirt, also cheap and not new, a little tight, untucked over -flat--front khaki chinos, no socks, English shoes, pebbled leather, brown, not new, but not very old either, probably expensive. Frayed laces, like you pull on them too hard when you tie them. Maybe indicative of a -self--discipline obsession."<br><br>"OK," Reacher said.<br><br>"OK what?"<br><br>"You notice things," Reacher said. "And I notice things. We're two of a kind. We're peas in a pod. I'm the only customer here now who was also here last night. I'm certain of that. And that's what you asked the staff. Had to be. That's the only reason the waiter would have pointed me out."<br><br>The guy turned back.<br><br>"Did you see a car last night?" he asked.<br><br>"I saw plenty of cars last night," Reacher said. "This is Sixth Avenue."<br><br>"A Mercedes Benz. Parked over there." The guy twisted again and pointed on a slight diagonal at a length of empty curb by a fire hydrant on the other side of the street.<br><br>Reacher said, "Silver, four-door sedan, an S-420, New York vanity plates starting OSC, a lot of city miles on it. Dirty paint, scuffed tires, dinged rims, dents and scrapes on both bumpers."<br><br>The guy turned back again.<br><br>"You saw it," he said.<br><br>"It was right there," Reacher said. "Obviously I saw it."<br><br>"Did you see it leave?"<br><br>Reacher nodded. "Just before eleven -forty--five a guy got in and drove it away."<br><br>"You're not wearing a watch."<br><br>"I always know what time it is."<br><br>"It must have been closer to midnight."<br><br>"Maybe," Reacher said. "Whatever."<br><br>"Did you get a look at the driver?"<br><br>"I told you, I saw him get in and drive away."<br><br>The guy stood up.<br><br>"I need you to come with me," he said. Then he put his hand in his pocket. "I'll buy your coffee."<br><br>"I already paid for it."<br><br>"So let's go."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"To see my boss."<br><br>"Who's your boss?"<br><br>"A man called Lane."<br><br>"You're not a cop," Reacher said. "That's my guess. Based on observation."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"Your accent. You're not American. You're British. The NYPD isn't that desperate."<br><br>"Most of us are Americans," the British guy said. "But you're right, we're not cops. We're private citizens."<br><br>"What kind?"<br><br>"The kind that will make it worth your while if you give them a description of the individual who drove that car away."<br><br>"Worth my while how?"<br><br>"Financially," the guy said. "Is there any other way?"<br><br>"Lots of other ways," Reacher said. "I think I'll stay right here."<br><br>"This is very serious."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>The guy in the suit sat down again.<br><br>"I can't tell you that," he said.<br><br>"Goodbye," Reacher said.<br><br>"Not my choice," the guy said. "Mr. Lane made it -mission--critical that nobody knows. For very good reasons."<br><br>Reacher tilted his cup and checked the contents. Nearly gone.<br><br>"You got a name?" he asked.<br><br>"Do you?"<br><br>"You first."<br><br>In response the guy stuck a thumb into the breast pocket of his suit coat and slid out a black leather business card holder. He opened it up and used the same thumb to slide out a single card. He passed it across the table. It was a handsome item. Heavy linen stock, raised lettering, ink that still looked wet. At the top it said: <i>Operational Security Consultants</i>.<br><br>"OSC," Reacher said. "Like the license plate."<br><br>The British guy said nothing.<br><br>Reacher smiled. "You're security consultants and you got your car stolen? I can see how that could be embarrassing."<br><br>The guy said, "It's not the car we're worried about."<br>Lower down on the business card was a name: <i>John Gregory</i>. Under the name was a subscript: <i>British Army, Retired</i>. Then a job title: <i>Executive Vice President</i>.<br><br>"How long have you been out?" Reacher asked.<br><br>"Of the British Army?" the guy called Gregory said. "Seven years."<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"SAS."<br><br>"You've still got the look."<br><br>"You too," Gregory said. "How long have you been out?"<br><br>"Seven years," Reacher said.<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"U.S. Army CID, mostly."<br><br>Gregory looked up. Interested. "Investigator?"<br><br>"Mostly."<br><br>"Rank?"<br><br>"I don't remember," Reacher said. "I've been a civilian seven years."<br><br>"Don't be shy," Gregory said. "You were probably a lieutenant colonel at least."<br><br>"Major," Reacher said. "That's as far as I got."<br><br>"Career problems?"<br><br>"I had my share."<br><br>"You got a name?"<br><br>"Most people do."<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Reacher."<br><br>"What are you doing now?"<br><br>"I'm trying to get a quiet cup of coffee."<br><br>"You need work?"<br><br>"No," Reacher said. "I don't."<br><br>"I was a sergeant," Gregory said.<br><br>Reacher nodded. "I figured. SAS guys usually are. And you've got the look."<br><br>"So will you come with me and talk to Mr. Lane?"<br><br>"I told you what I saw. You can pass it on."<br><br>"Mr. Lane will want to hear it direct."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. "Where is he?"<br><br>"Not far. Ten minutes."<br><br>"I don't know," Reacher said. "I'm enjoying my espresso."<br><br>"Bring it with you. It's in a foam cup."<br><br>"I prefer peace and quiet."<br><br>"All I want is ten minutes."<br><br>"Seems like a lot of fuss over a stolen car, even if it was a Mercedes Benz."<br><br>"This is not about the car."<br><br>"So what is it about?"<br><br>"Life and death," Gregory said. "Right now more likely death than life."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. There was less than a lukewarm -eighth--inch left, thick and scummy with espresso mud. That was all. He put the cup down.<br><br>"OK," he said. "So let's go."</p><h2>Oh My Goddess!

Walton Lillehei, who, along with colleagues at University Hospital in Minneapolis and a small band of pioneers elsewhere, accomplished what many experts considered to be an impossible feat: He opened the heart, repaired fatal defects, and made the miraculous routine.<br><br>Acclaimed author G. Wayne Miller draws on archival research and exclusive interviews with Lillehei and legendary pioneers such as Michael DeBakey and Christiaan Barnard, taking readers into the lives of these doctors and their patients as they progress toward their landmark achievement. In the tradition of works by Richard Rhodes and Tracy Kidder, <b>King of Hearts</b> tells the story of an important and gripping piece of forgotten science history.</p><p>The surgeon-as-rock-star mystique seems like it must have come straight out of Hollywood, but the myth had to begin more concretely. A good candidate is Minnesota's Dr. Walt Lillehei, the hard-working, hard-playing father of open-heart surgery, whose life is told in garish color in <i>King of Hearts</i> by journalist G. Wayne Miller. From his early brilliance, recovery from deadly lymphatic cancer, and dramatic repair of seemingly hopeless heart cases to the disintegration of his career at its peak thanks to an army of personal enemies and conviction on tax evasion counts, his story is consistently surprising and engaging. Fast cars, hard drinking, and plenty of women filled his time when he wasn't turning lives around with a few strokes of his scalpel, and the reader will find the surgeon's actions almost unbelievable--rarely endearing, but occasionally saintly. Combining this melodramatic biography with the fascinating story of the struggle for open-heart surgery, considered impossible little more than a generation ago, Miller makes a compelling case that the daring scientist was simply another side of the arrogant, absent-minded playboy. No ordinary biography, <i>King of Hearts</i> is breathless reading--you'll find yourself surfacing every few chapters to remind yourself its nonfiction. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>G.

In <i>The Art Lover</i> Carole Maso has created an elegant and moving narrative about a woman experiencing (and reliving) the most painful transitions of her life. Caroline, the novel's protagonist, returns to New York after the death of her father&#x2014;ostensibly to wrap things up and take care of necessary "business"&#x2014;where her memory and imagination conspire to lay before her all her griefs and joys in a rebellious progression. In different voices, employing a collage-like fragmentation, Maso gently unfolds <i>The Art Lover</i> in much the same way the fragile and prehistoric fiddlehead fern unfolds throughout the novel, bringing with subtle grace the ever-entangled feelings of grief and love into full and tender view. Various illustrations throughout.</p><p>Carole Maso is author of the novels AVA, The American Woman in the Chinese Hat, Ghost Dance, The Art Lover, and Defiance. She has also written several books of nonfiction. Maso is a professor of Literary Arts at Brown University.Caroline, a novelist and poet, returns from an isolated artists colony to Manhattan, where her widowed, art-historian father has recently died. As one strand of the narrative follows her rediscovery of the city--and of a friend diagnosed with AIDS--another follows the characters she creates in her prose; interspersed throughout are reproductions of pictures and newspaper clippings that inspire her. This narrative cord ruptures with the introduction of "Carole," the persona of Maso, and descriptions of herself at work on the novel while her own beloved friend is dying, Carole/the writer's art incapable of saving him. Despite its trendy structure and themes, this work is steered by anything but a narcissistic postmodernism. Maso ( Ghost Dance ) is not content to muse on the relationship between life and art; she brings to life a "bombardment of images and sounds," fashioning a pattern of astonishing complexity and beauty. The tough-mindedness, originality and wit of her perceptions are intoxicating. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Julia Pretl&#39;s Big Book of Beadwork: 32 Projects for Adventurous Beaders</h2><p><p>This volume brings together some of the best of Julia Pretl's bead collections.

It was dark -- a hot black stifling darkness that seemed to suck the breath out of him. He sensed movement, heard the whine of tires on pavement, but he had no idea where he was or how he'd gotten there. He tried to move his legs but couldn't. They were jammed up under his belly in a space that was far too small, and they seemed to be tied together somehow. </p><p> His hands were stuck behind him, shoved up against something hard. After several minutes of struggling he was finally able to shift his body enough to free them. He was stunned to discover that they, too, had been bound together in the same manner his legs were. The combination of their being tied too tight and being stuck under his body had cut off the circulation. At first his hands were nothing more than a pair of useless and inextricably connected dead-weight cudgels. After a few moments the blood returned to his fingers in a rush of needle-and-pin agony. </p><p> As his senses gradually reasserted themselves, he realized that the rough surface under his cheek was carpet of some kind, and from somewhere nearby came the distinctive smell of new rubber -- a spare tire. That meant he was in the trunk of someone's vehicle being taken God knows where. He tried to shout, but of course he couldn't do that, either. His mouth was taped shut. All that emerged from his throat was a guttural groan. </p><p> What was it you were you supposed to do if you found yourself trapped in a vehicle like that? Kick out the taillights, hang an arm out the hole, and signal for help? But he couldn't kick anything. He couldn't move his legs, and his bound hands were still useless. </p><p> As the man gradually understood the seriousness of his predicament, his heart beat faster while his breath quickened to short panicky gasps. For a while he was afraid he was going to pass out again, but he fought it -- fought to bring his breathing back under control. Fought to concentrate. What the hell was happening? Where was he? Who was doing this? And why? </p><p> He tried to remember something about what had gone on before. He had a dim recollection of something like a party. Lots of lights and laughter, lots of girls, lots of liquor. So had he gotten drunk and pissed someone off? Was that what was going on? He knew that given enough scotch he wasn't anyone's idea of Mr. Congeniality, but still... </p><p> Sweat trickled down the side of his face and dribbled into one eye, burning like fire. Without the use of his hands, there was no way to brush it away. </p><p> The vehicle slowed suddenly and swerved to the right, rolling him back onto his hands. Outside he heard the roar of a semi going past followed immediately by another and another. So they were on a busy freeway somewhere -- or had just left one. But where? As hot as it was, it had to be somewhere over the mountains -- somewhere in the desert. Palm Springs, maybe? Or maybe farther north, up toward Needles and Parker. </p><p> <i>Why can't I remember where I was or what happened?</i> he wondered. He had always prided himself on being able to hold his liquor. He wasn't like some of the guys he knew, high-powered wheeler-dealers who would have to call around after a wild night on the town, checking with valets at local watering holes to see where they had left their favorite Porsche or Ferrari. He usually knew exactly where he'd been. He also knew when he'd had enough. But now, his mind was fuzzy. He couldn't quite pull things together -- not just tonight, but what had gone on in the days before that, either. </p><p> The vehicle slowed again. He braced himself, expecting another right-hand turn. Instead, the vehicle turned sharply to the left and bounced off the pavement and onto a much rougher surface. Fine dust swirled inside the small space, filling his eyes and nostrils, making his eyes water and his nose run. Definitely the desert somewhere. </p><p> There was another hard jolting bump, then the vehicle came to a sudden halt. What must have been the driver's door opened and shut. And then there was nothing. No sound at all. At first he hoped and dreaded that the trunk lid would click open and his captor would free him, but that didn't happen. He strained his ears, hoping to establish if the freeway was still near enough that he'd be able to hear semis speeding past, but for the longest time, he heard nothing at all. He felt only the oppressive heat and wondered how long it would be before the oxygen ran out and he suffocated. </p><p> He felt it first. The car trembled as if it were alive, as if it were being racked by a bad case of the chills. Then he heard it -- a distant rumble growing louder and louder until it turned into an unmistakable roar. The car rocked in concert with the sound until the terrible roar and the shaking were one. It was then the man heard the shrill, earth-shattering screech of a fast-approaching freight train. The whistle sounded once, in a single, long, warning wail. Only then did he realize that whoever had locked him in the trunk had left him on the train tracks -- left him there to die. </p><p> He struggled desperately against his restraints, but it was no use. He couldn't free himself. The engine of the speeding eastbound train plowed into the stationary vehicle, peeling it open like an empty tin can and then dragging the wreckage along underneath the engine for the additional mile it took for the shaken engineer to finally bring the fully loaded train to a stop. As the engineer spoke to the 911 operator in Palm Springs, he reported having seen something fly up and out of the shattered vehicle, something that had looked more like a rag doll than it did a human being. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by J.A.

For those of you who may be new to the site, the last few months have been a bit of a bumpy ride since both my husband and my former employer simultaneously sent me packing in hopes of landing a younger model. </p><p> My soon-to-be-ex, aka Fang, as he's known in the blogosphere, called me yesterday. It was the first time I'd heard from him directly in several months. What surprised me more than anything was how much I DIDN'T feel when I heard his voice. That, I believe, is a good sign. It turns out Fang was calling, in his own imperious way, to make sure I'd be in court tomorrow so the divorce decree can be finalized. I could have given him grief about it. Could have claimed I was sick or maimed or just too annoyed to bother driving eight hours plus from Sedona over to L.A. And, had I done so, it would have sent him up a wall. You see, Fang needs this divorce right about now a whole lot more than I do. Our court appearance is scheduled Friday. Saturday is Fang's wedding day. </p><p> I've heard rumors that he and his blushing bride, aka Twink, are planning a big-deal celebration, a catered affair with all the right people in attendance at what used to be our joint domicile on Robert Lane. In view of the fact that Twink is expecting Fang's baby within weeks of the scheduled nuptials, you might think a little more discretion was called for, but discretion has never been Fang's long suit. For that matter, it must not be Twink's, either, since the baby was conceived some time prior to my abandoning our marriage bed. </p><p> For those of you who are concerned about my state of mind as I approach this change in marital status, don't be. I'm fine. I'm ready to make a clean break of it; glad to have what was clearly my sham of a marriage -- as far as Fang was concerned anyway -- over and done with. I'm moving on with my new life. When you're doing that, hanging on to the old one doesn't help. Neither does bitterness. As my mother is prone to point out, bitterness destroys the container it's in. </p><p> If I do say so myself, this particular container is going to be in pretty fine shape tomorrow when I show up in court. With my son's help, I've been working out. My personal shopper at Nordstrom's down in Scottsdale has set aside a couple of new outfits for me. I plan on picking up one of them on my way through Phoenix later on this afternoon. </p><p> In other words, for today anyway, I'm a rolling stone, and rolling stones gather no moss -- and do no blogging. </p><p> <i>Posted 7:23 a.m., September 15, 2005 by Babe</i> </p><p> </p><p> As soon as Ali Reynolds hauled her suitcase out of the closet, Samantha, Ali's now permanent refugee cat, disappeared. Completely. Ali found it hard to believe that a sixteen-pound, one-eared cat could pull off that kind of magicianship, but she could. </p><p> Six months earlier, a series of forced moves had left Sam in a new, unfamiliar home with a new owner who wasn't exactly enamored of cats. Over time, Ali and Sam had developed a grudging respect for each other. With the unwelcome appearance of a suitcase, however, all bets were off. For Sam, the sight of a suitcase and/or the dreaded cat crate brought back all those bad old times and sent the panicky kitty scrambling for someplace to hide. </p><p> It took Ali a good two hours -- two hours she didn't have -- to find the animal again, scrunched in beside the drainpipe behind the washing machine in the laundry room. And finding Sam was only part of the problem. Extricating the cat from her snug little hidey-hole and into the cat crate for a trip to Ali's parents' place was a whole other issue. Had it been any other weekend, Sam could have remained at home and been looked after by Ali's son, Christopher, but it happened that Chris was due at a two-day seminar in Phoenix starting early Saturday morning. </p><p> "Off to Grandma's with you," Ali said, retrieving the indignant cat and stuffing her into the waiting crate. "And you'd better behave yourself, too." </p><p> And so, hours later than she had intended, Ali finally finished packing. With Sam yowling in bitter protest, Ali left her hilltop mobile-h...</p></p><h2>1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear</h2><p>1606 William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear:</p><p>Professor James Shapiro, who teaches at Columbia University in New York, is the author of Rival Playwrights, Shakespeare and the Jews, and Oberammergau: The Troubling Story of the World&#39;s Most Famous Passion Play. 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare won the BBC FOUR Samuel Johnson Prize in 2006.

He has also translated poems by Ren� Char, Erica Pedretti, and Rainer Maria Rilke. He lives in Waltham, Massachusetts.The 26-year-old Belarusian Mort has made a big splash in Europe. With help from the popular, Pulitzer-winning Franz Wright, this thin, uneven, but decidedly exciting bilingual first U.S. edition shows how Mort's energies work. Some poems last just a few lines; others stretch out across pages of fast-moving prose, and the best bring into disturbing collision the difficult circumstances of Eastern Europe (crowds, relative poverty, bad weather) and the recent results of globalization (suicide bombers, teen culture, game shows with telephonic life lines). Mort says of her compatriots in Belarusian I, we gorged on dirt thinking it was bread and calls our future/ a gymnast on a thin thread of the horizon. Later poems reflect her move to the U.S. (she now resides in Virginia), and contemplate those who have made the same move before: of Polish Immigrants, she asks, how do they break away from the land/ where even stones take root. At her best, Mort shows a ragged power Americans might not otherwise know: she writes in a crackling prose poem, I protest against everything: low-quality goods in supermarkets, pigs in the subway, and those who protest against pigs in the subway... this is the only way to survive.<i> (Apr.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he turned to acting, he applied himself diligently, and many of his films have been box-office hits. At the end of each chapter he has one or more sentences on his personal philosophy.

Norris's formula consists primarily of positive thinking and visualizing in advance what will take place next, with added bits of advice on more specific subjects like dealing with failure and advancing beyond conceived limitations. The tone is didactic, and readers will find that the recommendations have the flavor of copy-book maxims. Further, the recapping of the plots of many of the star's films becomes tedious.

I&#39;ve been writing novels for over fifty years. I was lucky enough to miss the big wars and not get shot, but lucky enough to grow up among the heroes who had served in them and learn from their example. I have lucked into things continuously. I have done things which have seemed appalling at the time, disastrous even, but out of them has come another story or a deeper knowledge of human character and the ability to express myself better on paper and write books which people enjoy reading. Along the way, I have lived a life that I could never have imagined. I have been privileged to meet people from all corners of the globe, I have been wherever my heart has desired and in the process my books have taken readers to many, many places. I always say I&#39;ve started wars, I&#39;ve burned down cities and I&#39;ve killed hundreds of thousands of people - but only in my imagination! From being attacked by lions to close encounters with deadly reef sharks, from getting lost in the African bush without water to crawling the precarious tunnels of gold mines, from marlin fishing with Lee Marvin to near death from crash-landing a Cessna aeroplane, from brutal school days to redemption through writing and falling in love, Wilbur Smith tells us the intimate stories of his life that have been the raw material for his fiction. Always candid, sometimes hilarious and never less than thrillingly entertaining, On Leopard Rock is testament to a writer whose life is as rich and eventful as his novels are compellingly unputdownable.</p><p>Wilbur Smith is a global phenomenon: a distinguished author with a large and established readership built up over fifty-five years of writing with sales of over 130 million novels worldwide. Born in Central Africa in 1933, Wilbur became a full-time writer in 1964 following the success of When the Lion Feeds, and has since published forty-one global bestsellers, including the Courtney Series, the Ballantyne Series, the Egyptian Series, the Hector Cross Series and many successful standalone novels, all meticulously researched on his numerous expeditions worldwide. His books have now been translated into twenty-six languages. The establishment of the Wilbur &amp; Niso Smith Foundation in 2015 cemented Wilbur's passion for empowering writers, promoting literacy and advancing adventure writing as a genre.

Starting a paper fire under a car engine that is too cold to start, snowmobiling across water, blowing up outhouses, idiotic gun mishaps--these true stories are sometimes funny, sometimes sad. They are told alternately by the two narrators, whose pacing and phrasing serve the material well.

In this work Dan Rottenberg proves that they are wrong and shows how to do a successful search for probing the memories of living relatives, by examining marriage licenses, gravestones, ship passenger lists, naturalization records, birth and death certificates, and other public documents, and by looking for clues in family traditions and customs. Supplementing the &#34;how to&#34; instructions is a guide to some 8,000 Jewish family names, giving the origins of the names, sources of information about each family, and the names of related families whose histories have been recorded. Other features included a country-by-country guide to tracing Jewish ancestors abroad, a list of Jewish family history books, and a guide to researching genealogy in Mormon records and in Israel.</p><p>Rottenberg offers advice on tracing the roots of Jewish families and supplies the names and addresses of organizations that could aid the search. He includes a long list of names with genealogical information (LJ 5/1/77).<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>End of the Night</h2><p>Three men and a beautiful girl on a cross-country terror spree - a coast to coast rampage of stealing, kidnapping, rape and killing. Who were they? Where did they come from? Why did they do it? With chilling detail, John D. MacDonald unwraps the grotesque inner world of these four young psychopaths, and brings into terrifying focus the random, violent lusts that lie hidden between mischief and madness ...</p><p>John D. MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Civilization and Its Discontents</h2><p>2016 Reprint of the American Edition of 1930. In this seminal book, Sigmund Freud enumerates the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual. The primary friction stems from the individual&#39;s quest for instinctual freedom and civilization&#39;s contrary demand for conformity and instinctual repression. Many of humankind&#39;s primitive instincts (for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification) are clearly harmful to the well-being of a human community. As a result, civilization creates laws that prohibit killing, rape, and adultery, and it implements severe punishments if such commandments are broken. This process, argues Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that instills perpetual feelings of discontent in its citizens.</p><p><p> In <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em> Freud extends and clarifies his analysis of religion; analyzes human unhappiness in contemporary civilization; ratifies the critical importance of the death drive theory; and contemplates the significance of guilt and conscience in everyday life. The result is Freud&#x2019;s most expansive work, one wherein he discusses mysticism, love, interpretation, narcissism, religion, happiness, technology, beauty, justice, work, the origin of civilization, phylogenetic development, Christianity, the Devil, communism, the sense of guilt, remorse, and ethics. A classic, important, accessible work, Freud reminds us again why we still read and debate his ideas today. </p> <p> Todd Dufresne&#x2019;s introduction expands on why, according to the late Freud, psychoanalysis is the key to understanding individual and collective realities or, better yet, collective truths. The Appendices include related writings by Freud, contemporary reviews, and scholarly responses from Marcuse, Rieff, and Ricoeur. </p><p> <strong>Todd Dufresne</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Lakehead University. He has authored several books on Freud including <em>Killing Freud</em> (Continuum), and editions of <em>The Future of an Illusion</em> and <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> with Broadview Press. </p> <p> <strong>Gregory C. Richter</strong> is Professor of German and Linguistics at Truman State University and the translator of many works. </p></p><h2>Thomas Mann: A Life</h2><p>Author of such classics as <em>Buddenbrooks</em>, <em>Death in Venice</em>, <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, and <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature not half-way through his career, Thomas Mann was without doubt the leading German novelist of his era and one of the three or four great writers of our century.<br> <br> Now, in <em>Thomas Mann: A Life</em>, celebrated biographer Donald Prater illuminates the life and work of this gifted writer, from his upbringing in Lubeck, through his years in Munich, his exile in the United States, and his last years in Switzerland. Prater discusses Mann's tumultuous relationship with his novelist brother Heinrich, which Mann called, "the hardest of my existence," his homosexuality, his career as a prolific essayist, the vast achievement of his novels, and his love of music. Prater writes that as Mann's passion for the gramophone grew almost to a vice, the music became an important motif for his text and a stimulus in its composition. Indeed, Mann conceived of such books as <em>The Magic Mountain</em> as symphonic constructions, interweaving its themes in strict counterpoint. Prater also reveals the personal side of Mann, from his marriage to Katia and his relationships with their six children, all of whom remained marginal to his firmly dedicated life as a writer, to his obsession with the minor ups and downs of his health. Mann's seventy-fifth birthday, for example, found him in typical form: pursuing the usual daily routine of morning work, afternoon correspondence, evening relaxation with the gramophone, and considering the year's lecture tour; but depressed over ailments, which were more or less minor, of ear and throat. But, the particular strength of the biography is the attention Prater devotes to Mann's political thinking and his role in the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. In Mann's development from a nationalistic conservative to a vigorous, anti-Nazi humanist, Prater recognizes a fascinating and crucially important illustration of the "German problem" still so relevant to the Europe of today. Mann could hardly bear even to mention the name of Adolf Hitler, still less to write about the horrors of the concentration camps. And later in his life while still in exile, he admitted it was no easy matter to be a German writer, with conflicting feelings towards one's country "of rage, revulsion, the desire for its destruction, yet an attachment that is inalienable."<br> <br> Elegantly written and always stimulating, <em>Thomas Mann</em> depicts a man whose life and writing continue to impact our lives today. It will take its place as the major biography of Mann, and as a compelling portrait of 19th- and early 20th-century Germany and the political metamorphosis that country saw during Mann's lifetime.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Donald Prater</strong> is a freelance writer and translator.

When murder and mayhem ensue, Sir Hugh Corbett must thread through a maze of mystery while trying to unlock Bacon&#x2019;s great secrets.</p><p>P.C. DOHERT Y is the author of several acclaimed mystery series including The Sorrowful Mysteries. He lives in England.Starred Review. British veteran Doherty makes conveying the daily life of 14th-century England look easy in this sterling entry in his long-running series that features Hugh Corbett, keeper of the secret seal for Edward I (<i>Corpse Candle</i>, etc.). In 1303, a delegation of French scholars arrives at Corfe Castle to help decipher the secret writings of Roger Bacon, whose coded book is rumored to contain blueprints for inventions whose development could shift the balance of power in Europe. Corbett's men have recently stolen a copy of Bacon's book from France, despite the efforts of an unknown person to thwart them. Meanwhile, a killer armed with a crossbow has dispatched a number of young women connected with the castle. Those crimes may be connected with the apparently accidental deaths of several members of the French delegation. Doherty keeps the reader guessing even after one of the book's major mysteries is resolved. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fairley, author of <i>Drawing and Painting Hands and Feet</i>, "but they do require acute observation and thinking. If you follow the exercises in this book your skills will improve, and you will start to think about your work in a fresh way." Fairley begins by exploring the structure and anatomy of hands and feet, and offers several exercises for understanding muscles in movement. The next section is composed entirely of exercises in drawing hands and feet. The author employs a refreshingly wide array of media, including charcoal and graphite, ink, silverpoint, and pastels. Several of the exercises are composed using one's own hands and feet as models. Fairley's passion for his subject comes alive in these simple exercises as he stresses and masterfully illustrates the inherent energy and expressiveness of hands and feet in movement and repose. He ends the book by exploring how to incorporate hands and feet in a natural way into one's painting, and shows his works in acrylic, watercolor, and oil by way of illustration. <i>--Mary Ribesky</i><b>Robert E.

God Loves You!: A Collection of stories and Message by Peter Letchford</h2><p>A compilation of the stories of Peter Letchford--communicator, pastor, missionary. About Peter Letchford Peter Letchford was born February 16, 1917 in Sevenoaks, Kent, England to Arthur and Beatrice Letchford. He graduated as one of the two &#x201c;poor boys&#x201d; from Sevenoaks School (1935). He studied at Oxford University, matriculating with a BA, BMus, &#x2018;42, MA &#x2019;45. While a student, he served in the leadership of the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. Upon graduation, Peter answered the call to work with the Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF). Along with his colleague Ginger Wright, he was instrumental in establishing the education system in the northwestern part of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Many of his graduates became national leaders at the time of Zambia&#x2019;s independence in 1964. During his subsequent tenure as Canadian Director with AEF in Toronto, Peter met and married Dorothy in 1960. Peter&#x2019;s career included helping to establish the Graduate School of Missions at Columbia Bible College (now Columbia International University), senior pastor at Loudonville Community Church (Albany, NY), General Director of The Hildenborough 156 Evangelistic Trust (England), and as pastoral associate at First Presbyterian Church (Augusta, GA). Peter was an excellent communicator using stories from his young life through to his later life. With this skill he was able to take a subject that needed clarifying by using incidents from his life to illustrate a point he was making. Many of these were told with a sense of humor and wit. Whether in table conversations or in sermons, this gift kept his audiences spellbound. Peter was known for his commitment to God, his love for his wife, delight in his children, belief in others, wisdom, intellectual curiosity, compassion, and humor</p><p>Jessica Gerlichs is granddaughter to Peter Letchford</p><h2>The Cook&#39;s Bible: The Best of American Home Cooking</h2><p>The Cook&#39;s Bible takes the mystery out of preparing a great meal. What&#39;s the ideal ratio of oil to vinegar in a vinaigrette? Kimball gives you the answer: 4 1/2 to 1. What&#39;s the secret to perfect roast chicken? A 375(degree) oven and a 170(degree) internal temperature for the thigh. How about the toughest kitchen challenge of all, piecrust? Kimball makes it easy with the right ingredients (including Crisco and butter) and illustrated step-by-step instructions. For these and the rest of America&#39;s best-loved dishes - vegetable soup, poached salmon, roast beef, barbecued ribs, homemade pizza, waffles, chocolate chip cookies, and many others - Kimball has tested and retested to deliver the definitive recipes. In addition to these master recipes, Kimball also serves up a generous helping of appealing variations - nearly 450 recipes in all. Throughout, Kimball elucidates kitchen procedures - butterflying a chicken, for instance, or dicing an onion - with more than 250 beautifully rendered step-by-step illustrations. And he also provides lucid guidance on what kitchen equipment you need and what you can live without - a microwave oven is optional, but good knives are essential - including brand names, model numbers, and prices. From recipes to techniques to equipment, here is a one-volume master class in American home cookery, a cooking school in print for beginners and experienced cooks alike.</p><p>Chris Kimball founded <em>Cook's Magazine</em> in 1980; it has grown to a paid circulation of 1,000,000. He hosts <em>America's Test Kitchen</em> and <em>Cook's Country</em>, which are the top-rated cooking shows on public television, reaching 2 million viewers per week in over 94% of American households. Kimball is a regular contributor to both the <em>Today Show</em> and the <em>CBS Early Show</em>. He has been written up in most major newspapers, many national magazines, including <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Time</em>, and regularly contributes to NPR's <em>Morning Edition</em>, including doing a regular Thanksgiving segment. He will also host a public radio show on cooking starting in the fall of 2010.What Gideon is to the hotel room, Kimball will soon be to the kitchen: inspirational, informative and probably ubiquitous. In this compendium of facts and firm opinions, the founding editor of Cook's Illustrated magazine details the research that informs his positions on the best pots, thermometers and knives and the value of pasta machines, microwaves and ice-cream makers. This evaluative approach extends to the 400 intensively tested recipes that advocate preferred methods for cooking rice, grains, fish, meat, poultry, sweets and more. Kimball dispels many widely held misconceptions as he asserts that an overnight soaking of dried beans is "vastly preferable" to a quick-soak and that a tightly trussed bird will roast unevenly. It took 33 tries in Kimball's count before he achieved the perfect pie crust; following his progress is like solving a delicious mystery. Some bread bakers may question the author's praise for rapid-rise yeast and his declaration that saltless bread is "inedible" (thereby dismissing a tradition of Tuscan bread-making), but these are quibbles about a highly personal book that tells not only how to prepare specific foods but why. For many, Kimball, who comes across as a purist's Martha Stewart, will be the ultimate source for such kitchen basics as the best method for roasting beef (a speedy 400 degrees for tenderloin; a more leisurely bout at 250 for tough bottom round). Kimball's experiments demonstrate that even experienced cooks don't know all the answers, although everyone will know more after reading this impressive compilation. 200 halftone illustrations not seen by PW. 40,000 first printing; BOMC/Good Cook selection; author tour. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coyote Blue</h2><p>Sam Hunter, a yuppie salesman who has everything he needs except the beautiful Calliope&#39;s love, confronts Coyote, the Indian trickster god, and his own forgotten and buried life as Samson Hunts Alone, a native American outlaw</p><p>This is an accelerating comedy with shadows setting off the wry, polished humor.

He includes his own variations on traditional British dishes, such as Welsh rarebit.</p><p>What a likeable cook and writer Rick Stein is, apparently quite without side or any need to posture. Tirelessly generous, <i>Food Heroes</i> salutes those people who work hard, in the face of market pressures and often widespread indifference, to make available the very best British produce. Cheese, eggs, poultry, meat and game, fruit and seafood--the list of foodstuffs over which many of us have relinquished any claim to demand quality is a long and depressing one. Top marks, then to Stein for travelling the country and bringing a bit of publicity to those who labour in the vineyard. He is remarkably good at making clear just why quality matters so much, not only in terms of flavour, but on humanitarian grounds too. (He pointedly muses on how very much more cruelty might be prevented if single-issue anti-hunt campaigners broadened their concerns to include intensive farming.)<p> Some of the names here are more familiar than others: many people have eaten Mrs Kirkham's remarkable Lancashire cheese (though some apparently think she is no more real then Mr Kipling), or enjoyed the products of Loch Fyne and the Duchy of Cornwall; they are merely the most prominent among more than 300 producers and suppliers listed in the extraordinarily thorough and useful directory. One wishes them all well and hopes that this book (and the TV series) will have an appreciable effect on the nation's food buying. At least no-one can say that Rick Stein hasn't tried. The recipes he produces to demonstrate how to make the best of this fine produce are, as always, simple and impeccable, mingling a nice appreciation for tradition with a clear-sighted modern practicality. Roast Grouse with Bread Sauce and all the Trimmings rubs shoulders, as it were, with Medallions of Venison with Red Wine and Morello Cherries accompanied by Roasted Hazelnut Sp�tzle (a remarkable dish), while simple, old-fashioned puddings like Coeur � la Cr�me and Summer Pudding sit happily alongside chef's creations such as Fresh Raspberry Tart in Coconut and Hazelnut Pastry. The book is a feast and a pleasure, and if used as Rick Stein intends, may make the world a slightly better place. --<i>Robin Davidson</i></p>Rick Stein&#39;s &#34;Food Heroes&#34; is not about his favourite chefs as might at first be assumed. It is about the top food producers in Britain today. His love of fresh ingredients is well-known and here he travels the length and breadth of the country in his hunt for people of like mind, people who care more about their produce than their profit. Whilst acknowledging supermarkets today offer a range of foods far more global and wide-ranging than ever dreamt of, he draws the cooks attention to ingredients fresher and better than those sold by profit-making conglomerates. Handmade cheeses, organic watercress, free-range chickens and ducks and his favourite, freshly caught fish. Stein meets the people and explains their philosophy behind what could all too easily be loss-making ventures. But such is their belief in what they do they can translate it to chefs like Stein to promote and educate the general public. Accompanied by over 100 scrumptious Stein recipes, and attractively illustrated with colour photographs, this is an ideal gift to anyone wanting to cook and taste the very best of British produce. - Lucy Watson</p><h2>The Freedom of the Poet</h2><p>The late American poet&#39;s critical explorations into the works and tempers of his fellows, from Shakespeare to Whitman, from Marlowe to Yeats, Thomas, and Lowell, together with five stories</p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Shoot, Its Only Me</h2><p>The long-time king of show business offers a chronicle of his life and career, from Hollywood to the battlefields of North Africa, Europe, Korea, and Vietnam</p><p>The book's description, "Bob Hope's comedy history of the United States," is erroneous and misleading. The only comedy history dealt with is Hope's own (over 60 years in show business). For anyone who has read others of Hope's many books-- Have Tux, Will Travel , I Owe Russia $1200 --there is little in the way of new material. In fact, the earlier books provide more depth. However, for readers under 30 who do not know much (if anything) about the institution that is Bob Hope and for those who would like a refresher course, this book is a delight. Co-written with Shavelson (who wrote, produced, and/or directed some of Hope's movies), this rarely deviates from Hope's rapid-fire delivery. Hope has often been labeled a hawk, a title he disputes here. "I was only a hawk when there was a chance that we could win and get out of Viet Nam quickly."

Zieselman, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, New York</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Writing with Hollywood producer-director Shavelson, Hope revisits the years from 1940 onward, during which he built his singular showbiz career with radio, movie and TV performances. Although he numbers several American presidents among his enthusiatic rooters, the star stresses that he values most the responses from members of the armed forces, whom he entertained around the world through a half-century of conflicts. The stories and jokes he tells here echo the comic's wry wit, counterpointed by strains of his theme song, "Thanks for the Memory," which pay tribute to war's victims and dead friends (Bing Crosby, Jack Benny, Jerry Colonna). The book is an odds-on crowd pleaser, funny and touching. Photos not seen by PW.

First of all, you get to do all those corny, young-love things that new couples have been doing since the dawn of time: hold hands on the beach, watch the sun set, make out like teenagers. Then there are the more practical advantages. For example, you get to mention how the trash needs to be taken out, and if you have a well-trained boyfriend, he&#x2019;ll take it out. You get to look in the mirror and mutter, &#x201c;I look like warmed-over toast today,&#x201d; and he&#x2019;ll lavish you with compliments. If you have a <i>really</i> well trained boyfriend, you might even get a box of chocolates now and then (my own personal weakness). At the end of the day, a boyfriend is a very good thing.</p> <p>But there&#x2019;s a downside.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, Ethan is as smart as a whip, 100 percent thoughtful, and devastatingly, bewilderingly, <i>unrelentingly</i> hunky. But now that I have a boyfriend, I can&#x2019;t really sit around all afternoon eating Fritos and ice cream and watching old reruns of <i>Golden Girls.</i> Not that that&#x2019;s the sort of thing I do on a regular basis&#x2014;at least not anymore. Ethan is under the impression that I&#x2019;m the kind of girl who listens to hip music and reads the latest thought-provoking books in her spare time.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m not sure where he got that idea, but I have to try to live up to it as much as possible.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m Dixie Hemingway, no relation to you-know-who. I used to be a deputy with the Sarasota Sheriff&#x2019;s Department, until my whole world came crashing down around me and I quit the force, or to be accurate, the force quit me. I think the official words on my discharge report were &#x201c;unfit for duty.&#x201d; Now I&#x2019;m a professional pet sitter on Siesta Key, an eight-mile barrier island that sits just off the shore of Sarasota, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve built a pretty good business for myself. Most of my clients are cats, but I have a few regular dogs, too, with an occasional bird or iguana, and even recently a giant tank full of priceless exotic fish. I draw the line at snakes, though. Some people think snakes make a real neat pet. Those people are crazy.</p> <p>It was a little after 5:00 P.M. when I left my last client for the day and pulled my Bronco out onto Ocean Boulevard, heading south toward the center of town. My plan was to stop by Beezy&#x2019;s Bookstore on my way home and buy something impressive to read. Beezy&#x2019;s is the type of place where you can find the latest blockbuster novel right next to an old, dog-eared copy of <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels,</i> complete with faded yellow highlighting and scribbled notes in the margins.</p> <p>I was looking forward to it. I hadn&#x2019;t been there in years, but I was a regular customer when I was a little girl. I remember sitting in the aisle with my older brother, Michael, while our grandmother was shopping at the market across the street. I loved the feeling of being surrounded by all those dusty thoughts and dreams of writers from all over the world, all with their own story to tell. I distinctly remember the moment I realized I&#x2019;d never live long enough to read every book in the world. I cried for days.</p> <p>The northern end of Ocean Boulevard is mostly old houses and runs along a stretch of beach, but as you get closer to the center of town, all kinds of shops start popping up on both sides. Most people just assume the street was named for its breathtaking view of the Gulf of Mexico to the west, but in fact, the man who originally bought up all the land in this area named it after his wife, whose name just happened to be Ocean.</p> <p>I was keeping an eye out for a parking spot when something in the rearview mirror caught my eye. It was an old, cherry red convertible sports car right behind me, flashing its headlights and weaving from side to side. The driver was a thin-faced man with expensive-looking sunglasses perched on top of his pale, balding head. He had that blank, set-in-stone expression that only a true&nbsp;&#x2026; well, let&#x2019;s just say a true <i>jerk</i> can muster. He was revving his engine and drawing within inches of my back bumper, waving his hands in a frantic &#x201c;Speed up!&#x201d; gesture.</p> <p>Now, I&#x2019;m no angel. I&#x2019;ve been known to drift outside of the traffic laws every once in a while. I even got pulled over once for going thirty miles per hour over the speed limit, which sounds bad enough except the speed limit was seventy. In my defense, I was twenty-one years old and dumb as a fruitcake, driving my own car for the first time in my life, not to mention I was the only car on the road for miles. I was midway along State Road 84, a sun-parched two-lane highway that cuts a straight horizontal swath right through the Florida Everglades. The only thing you have to worry about running into there (besides a cop with a speed gun) is the occasional alligator lumbering across the broiling asphalt.</p> <p>But here we were in the middle of a beach town, not to mention in the middle of tourist season&#x2014;shops and caf�s on either side of the street, happy retirees on two-person bicycles ambling along on the shoulder, and kids skipping around with ice cream cones and listening to music on their iPods. I was already going about five miles per hour over the limit. There was no way I was speeding up just so some ember-head could get to his golf game two minutes earlier. I gently eased off the gas and slowed to the actual speed limit, which in town is only twenty-five.</p> <p>I looked up in the mirror and saw the man smack his forehead in exasperation. His cheeks were beginning to turn a deep shade of plum. He leaned his head out over the striped lines in the road to see if he could pull around me. Normally, I&#x2019;d stick to my guns and cruise along at exactly the posted limit just to teach him a lesson, but I was pretty sure he was about to make a run for it, and there was too much traffic to do it safely.</p> <p>I decided to act like a grown-up&#x2014;something I do every once in a while. I flicked on my turn signal and started to slow down, but before I&#x2019;d even moved over to the side his tires screeched and he came peeling around my back bumper into the oncoming lane. I put my face in a perfect &#x201c;You bald jackass&#x201d; expression so he&#x2019;d know exactly what I thought of his antics, but he didn&#x2019;t even give me the pleasure of shooting me a dirty look as he roared by. He just glanced at me with a blank expression on his face, all business, as if nothing were wrong.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. Siesta Key is home to only about three thousand full-time residents, and thanks to our sugar-white sand and bathtub-warm waters, we have another three or four thousand part-timers on top of that, but it&#x2019;s a whole different story in the winter. That&#x2019;s when the snowbirds descend on our little paradise, and the population swells to about twenty-four thousand. While folks up north are shoveling snow and chipping ice off their windshields, we&#x2019;re sipping daiquiris out on the deck or watching dolphins frolic in the Gulf. On Christmas Day, you can find whole families headed down to the water to spread their presents out on beach blankets. The kids play in the surf with their new toys while Mom and Dad blissfully soak in the sun with a good book and a beer or two.</p> <p>There are some snowbirds, though&#x2014;like my friend here in the red convertible&#x2014;who have a genuinely hard time smoothing out their feathers once they land. It&#x2019;s as if they haven&#x2019;t unpacked yet and they&#x2019;re dragging all their baggage around everywhere they go, full of unpaid bills, ungrateful children, looming deadlines, and mounting household chores. Not that I&#x2019;m complaining. We love our snowbirds. They spend lots of money and keep us all employed and happy. Plus, they flock here from all over the world, so it gives our little town a bit of cosmopolitan cachet.</p> <p>I pulled back out on the road and told myself that once ol&#x2019; Baldy McGrumpypants had spent a few more days here, he&#x2019;d settle down and all that pent-up anger and anxiety would melt away. He&#x2019;d eventually nestle in and be just as happy and serene as the rest of us. At least, that&#x2019;s what I hoped.</p> <p>Not more than a minute later I had a sneaky feeling something wasn&#x2019;t quite right. I&#x2019;d been keeping an eye out for the bookstore, so I&#x2019;d looked away from the road for a second, and when I looked back, coming at me like a speeding meteor was the back end of an old black Cadillac, its fin-shaped taillights glowing bright red.</p> <p>I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could and heard a gut-wrenching squeal as I felt the Bronco veer slightly off kilter. I&#x2019;m not completely sure, but I think at least three or four key scenes from my life flashed before my eyes as I slid to a grinding stop, just inches from the Cadillac&#x2019;s rear bumper.</p> <p>I looked down at my hands. They were gripping the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles had turned chalk white, and I could literally hear my heart beating in my chest. In front of the Cadillac was a pileup of at least three more cars, and in the oncoming lane farther down was a disabled landscaping truck with a red front grille and three steeple-high palm trees swaying in the breeze in the back.</p> <p>I let out a sigh of relief, which turned out to be a little premature. I glanced up, and sure enough there in the rearview mirror was a bright pink Volkswagen Beetle speeding straight for the back of my car. I had just enough time to see a young woman behind the wheel, absentmindedly twirling her long blond curls in one hand and holding a cell phone to her ear with the other. As I slammed my open palm down on the horn to get her attention, the thought flashed across my mind that she could only have been operating the steering wheel with her knees. I thought to myself, <i>If we live through this, I&#x2019;m going to kill that little bitch.</i></p> <p>I closed my eyes and prepared for impact, but the woman must have looked up and hit the brakes at the last moment, because I heard what sounded like a pack of howler monkeys and then when she did hit me, the Bronco lurched forward only a foot or so, bumping into the Cadillac in front of me with a loud <i>clank!</i></p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked around. Everything seemed to be in one piece. Then I looked up in the rearview mirror, primarily to see if the woman was in good enough shape for a sound beating, and all I could see was a mass of blond curls spread out over her dashboard. Without even thinking I jumped out of the car and ran back as fast as my legs would carry me.</p> <p>As I approached the car I could see her through the windshield. She was wearing a black and white striped tank top and a green barrette in her hair. Her head was lying completely still on the steering wheel, and her left arm was hanging listlessly at her side. As I approached the driver&#x2019;s-side door, I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the worst, and just as I reached out to try the door handle she jolted her head up, eyes wide with alarm. She rolled down the window halfway, and that&#x2019;s when I realized she was still cradling the phone to her ear.</p> <p>&#x201c;I have to go,&#x201d; she said into the phone. &#x201c;I just hit somebody.&#x201d;</p> <p>She flicked the phone closed and dropped it down into the cup holder next to the seat and stared straight ahead. I reached out and put one hand on the hood of her car to steady myself. &#x201c;Umm, are you okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>She looked up at the mirror in her sun visor and blinked her eyes a couple of times, like she was checking her makeup. &#x201c;Yeah, I think so.&#x201d;</p> <p>I thought to myself, <i>Now is the time to strangle this woman to death</i>. Just then she looked at me, pulled her curly locks away from her face, and said, &#x201c;Are <i>you</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>She was much younger than I&#x2019;d thought, probably not a day older than the legal driving age, which in Florida is eighteen. Her eyes started to well with tears.</p> <p>I sighed. &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m fine. Why don&#x2019;t you put that phone to good use and call 911.&#x201d;</p> <p>She touched a finger to her lip. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re bleeding.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your lip is bleeding.&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked at my reflection in the backseat window. She was right. My lower lip was bleeding, but not badly, just smudged with a bit of red, as if I&#x2019;d been interrupted in the middle of putting on lipstick. &#x201c;I must have bit my lip when you hit me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Handing me a tissue, she said, &#x201c;I am so sorry. I was talking on my phone and I guess I just got distracted.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s alright,&#x201d; I said, dabbing at my lip. &#x201c;I used to be young and stupid, too. Just call 911. I&#x2019;m gonna go up and see what happened.&#x201d;</p> <p>But I already knew what had happened: Baldy McGrumpypants. He&#x2019;d probably been weaving in and out of traffic and caused an accident. I tried to stay positive, but with so many cars and people around, it was hard not to think someone could&#x2019;ve been hurt. As I headed up I glanced at my rear bumper to assess the damage.</p> <p>My Bronco is pale yellow, like homemade lemon ice cream, so it shows even the slightest nick or speck of dirt, but there was hardly a scratch, just a couple of dime-sized dents on the chrome guard. The girl&#x2019;s front fender was slightly concussed, but nothing a good body shop couldn&#x2019;t hammer back into shape in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked back at the girl, who was already on the phone with 911. She was leaning her head out the window. I hate it when teenaged girls call me ma&#x2019;am. She said, &#x201c;What street is this?&#x201d;</p> <p>If she hadn&#x2019;t looked so serious I would have thought she was joking. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ocean Boulevard.&#x201d;</p> <p>She gave me a quick thumbs-up and then got back on the phone, gesticulating wildly with her hands. I could tell she was describing the accident to the emergency dispatcher.</p> <p><i>Okay,</i> I thought to myself, <i>maybe I was never</i> that <i>young and stupid,</i> but I had to smile. She was just a kid, and she was lucky. We both were. Except for a bloody lip and a few tears, we&#x2019;d both come out smelling like roses. I had a terrible feeling not everyone up ahead had been quite so fortunate.</p> <p>I reached into the Bronco and switched off the ignition. At first I thought I&#x2019;d better grab my backpack in case there were any serious injuries to contend with. I keep it stocked with all kinds of supplies for pet emergencies: scissors, bandages, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, a pocketknife, etc. Then I told myself I was probably overreacting. I tend to have a pretty healthy imagination. Plus, every once in a while my old cop training comes bubbling up to the surface and I have to remind myself that it&#x2019;s no longer my job to protect the public welfare.</p> <p>I took the backpack anyway, slinging it over my shoulder as I dropped my car keys down in the hip pocket of my cargo shorts and headed toward the front of the pileup. There was a burly man with short-cropped black hair in a blue business suit standing next to the black Cadillac in front of me. He was holding a monogrammed handkerchief to his forehead and talking to an elderly woman who was sitting at the driver&#x2019;s wheel.</p> <p>As I got closer I heard the man say to her, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not a cop. I said the cops are probably on their way.&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman wore what looked like a man&#x2019;s overcoat over a white dress, with a white hat sitting atop her perfectly coiffed hair, with that wiglike, hair-sprayed look they give you at the beauty shop, and her makeup looked like it had been applied with a child&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;lips smeared beet red and powdery pink cheeks. She wore a lavender scarf wrapped tightly around her neck and tied in a bow at her throat, with white gloves stretched tautly over her hands.</p> <p>I said, &#x201c;Are you folks okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>I heard the woman mutter under her breath in a smoker&#x2019;s growl, <i>&#x201c;Bastard!&#x201d;</i></p> <p>The burly man smiled at me as he pulled the bloody handkerchief away from his brow. There was a scratch about an inch long in the middle of his forehead. He pointed at the baby blue BMW in front ...</p></p><h2>Wings: A History of Aviation from Kites to the Space Age</h2><p>A narrative history of the development of human flight discusses how the enthusiasm of various amateurs gave way to the aviation industry, citing the periods of setback and danger that marked the achievements of numerous flight pioneers. 20,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Tom D. Crouch</b> is senior curator of the aeronautics division at the National Air &amp; Space Museum and lives in Fairfax, Virginia.National Air and Space Museum curator Crouch (A Dream of Wings; The Bishop's Boys) exuberantly surveys the entirety of aviation history. Wealthy aristocrat George Cayley progressed from a helicopter toy (1796) and model gliders (1804) to a glider capable of lifting a human (1849). After Cayley came a parade of pioneers, including John Joseph Montgomery, the "first American to leave the ground on wings of his own design" (1884). Otto Lilienthal made 2,000 glider flights, and his 1896 death during an airborne accident piqued the Wright Brothers' interest. At this point, Crouch carries the narrative aloft, taking note of the exhilarating exhibitions by barnstorming "aerial gypsies" after the WWI aircraft production boom. With the Air Mail Act of 1925, "Post Office officials realized that they were laying the foundation for commercial aviation in the United States." The Allies in WWII learned much from downed Messerschmitts and other Nazi rocket secrets, ushering in a new era of high-speed aerodynamics that cued a shift from aviation to aerospace (travel beyond earth's atmosphere). Computers brought change; in-flight movies were introduced in 1961; and weather-beaten hangars were replaced by gleaming terminals. With international tourism came the spread of American commercial culture. The book concludes with September 11 and the airline losses and layoffs that followed. Crouch notes that his history was "30 years in the making," and his exhaustive research is evident in 42 pages of notes and a vast array of sources. Capturing the romance of flight along with successes, failures and many memorable figures from Lindbergh to Yeager, this is a book that soars, a worthy celebration of the centennial of the Wright Brothers' first flight. 125 illus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>South Carolina (Life in the Thirteen Colonies)</h2><p>Presents the history of South Carolina, from its earliest beginnings in the sixteenth century up to the time of the American Revolution.</p><p>Grade 3-6&#x2013;This compact volume relates general information about pre- and post-Revolutionary War-era South Carolina in brisk, age-appropriate prose, but inexplicably overlooks numerous details and uses imprecise, sometimes misleading language. The author repeatedly refers to South Carolina's "backcountry," but only vaguely describes this unincorporated zone outside of Charles Town, leaving readers to wonder just where it began and ended. The description of "Southern Houses" makes no distinction between the homes constructed in Charleston and those built inland. The book's only reference to favored son and Revolutionary War icon Francis Marion appears in a caption, and the text makes mention of landmarks like "the Liberty Tree"&#x2013;ostensibly "a symbol of freedom throughout the colonies"&#x2013;but says nothing about where it was or how it came to be regarded thus. The numerous photos and period reproductions are satisfactory, but the very first one is "a drawing from Columbus's time" that shows him exploring the New World. His ship's sail sports a black cross, which directly contradicts the statement, "The ships bore a blood-red cross on their sails. This was the symbol of Spain." An index, local recipe, and craft project follow the text.

In addition to a wealth of recipes, the book gives capsule portraits of local features: a fish market, an olive oil press, a bakery, a shepherd cheese&#x2013;maker. Headnotes describe local folklore and traditions and what makes the food of Southern Italy a world on its own. Included are recipes for focaccias, pizzas and savory pies; soups and minestre; sauces for pasta; pasta, beans, rice, and other grains; fish and seafood; meat and poultry; vegetables; salads; and desserts.</p></p><p>Most Italian-American cooking derives from southern Italian fare, yet few cookbooks offer the parent cuisine in all its delicious variety. Nancy Harmon Jenkins's <i>Cucna del Sole</i> does so expertly. A collection of 200 approachable recipes from Sicily, Calabria, Bastilicata, Puglia, and Campania, the dishes include the likes of Pasta with Tomato and Toasted Almond Pesto; Swordfish in Lemon Caper Sauce; and Slow-Cooked Lamb with Wild Mushrooms. There's a comprehensive section on breads, pizza, and calzone, and a brief but attractive chapter of desserts, such as ricotta tart, Frozen Coffee Pudding, and, of course, cannoli. Good ingredient notes and traveler's advice are present, too. <p> In her other books, including <i>The Essential Mediterranean</i>, Jenkins offers not only mouth-watering formulas, but pertinent context; the book is also rich in "backstories" like Sicilian Savory Pies, and Pizza in Napoli.

Merwin, Thomas McGrath, Robert Lowell, James Dickey, Galway Kinnell, and Donald Hall</p><p>The overriding question posed in poet Bly's ( Selected Poems ) collection of essays is, "Where do we go to find poetry that flies?" The book reflects 30 years of musing on the answers, with specific reference to contemporary American poetry (though few women are welcomed as members of this club). The volume is divided into three parts. "Looking for Dragon Smoke" compiles the various platforms and philosophies of Bly's magazine The Fifties, The Sixties and The Seventies. "The Bread of This World: Twelve Contemporary Poets," showing Bly at his most inspired, concentrates on individual poets--James Wright, Robert Lowell, Denise Levertov and nine others. "Educating the Rider and the Horse" consists of essays charting the direction of poetry and examining the relationship of intellect, politics, form and, most important, "wildness" to the genre. Throughout, Bly criticizes American poets for their willingness to abandon inward contemplation: "Poetry without inwardness or revolutionary feeling has no choice but to end in a kind of fabricated grossness," he argues. Provocative and opinionated at their best, Bly's inside views are without exception seriously considered. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pursuit of Victory: The Life and Achievement of Horatio Nelson</h2><p>How did Horatio Nelson achieve such extraordinary success? In this authoritative biography, the eminent scholar Roger Knight places him firmly in the context of the Royal Navy of the time. Nelson was passionate and relentless from the outset of his career; his charisma and his coolness in battle are legendary. But his success depended also on the strength of intelligence available to him, the quality of the ships he commanded, the potency of his guns, and the skill of his seamen. Based on a vast array of new sources, this biography demolishes many of the myths that have for two centuries surrounded Nelson. Knight demonstrates that this great Romantic hero was in his time a shrewd political operator and often a difficult subordinate. He was occasionally naive, often impatient, and only happy when completely in command. Readers will emerge from this biography with a greatly enriched understanding of this singular man-one who was brilliant, severely flawed, and never to be crossed. Errata pp. 638 - 665: http://www.perseusbookspromos.com/docs/KnightErrataPP638-665.pdf</p><p><b>Roger Knight</b> is one of Britain's foremost experts on naval history and a renowned Nelson scholar. He was the chief curator and deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, London, and is now visiting professor of naval history at the Greenwich Maritime Institute.<i>Starred Review.</i> Adm. Horatio Nelson became a national idol after smashing Napoleon's fleet in the 1798 Battle of the Nile. Killed in the victory at Trafalgar in 1805, he became England's greatest naval hero. The 200 years since have produced an avalanche of biographies, but Knight's book may be the best. No reader should shrink from its size because it's a page-turner. Entering the Royal Navy at 12 (the usual age), Nelson quickly demonstrated the skill, aggressiveness and charisma of a born leader. It didn't hurt that he had a genius for charming superiors, inspiring fierce loyalty from seamen and befriending colleagues. But Nelson was a man of his time, fawning over royalty, pursuing prize money, quick to defend slights to his rank and obsessively scheming for publicity and promotion. He could also be a vicious disciplinarian. In addition to this lucid, warts-and-all portrayal of his subject, Knight paints a vivid picture of the warfare in which Nelson excelled. Handling an 18th-century man-of-war required as much skill as maneuvering a 21st-century aircraft carrier. Directing a battle fleet before the age of steam and radio probably required even more. The author makes it all clear in this highly readable, authoritative and deeply satisfying biography. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some reviewers call <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> the best reference work on animals ever published. Others call it the legacy left to us by famed zoologist and animal lover, Bernhard Grzimek. The accolades and praise go on for the newest addition to Gales line of reference titles. The original 13-vol. set, published in Germany in the late 1960s, is internationally renowned for its scientific reporting, coverage and illustrations, and serves as a major point of reference for researchers and students studying the animal kingdom. Thorough articles familiarize readers with animals found everywhere on the globe, detailing their life cycles, predators, food systems, overall ecology and much more. Staying true to the original scientific pedigree, Gale enlisted prominent advisors and contributors from the international scientific community to incorporate recent developments in the animal world. Our new editions of <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> are sure to serve the needs of students at every academic level.</p></p><p>The final volumes of the massive revised <i>Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia</i> have finally rolled off the press. We reviewed volumes 8 to 11 (<i>Birds</i>) in the January 1 &amp; 15, 2003, issue, and volumes 4 and 5 (<i>Fishes</i>), volume 6 (<i>Amphibians</i>), and volume 7 (<i>Reptiles</i>) in the December 1, 2003, issue. Volume 17 is a comprehensive index. <p>H. C. Bernhard Grzimek hoped his original encyclopedia would "disseminate knowledge of the animals and love for them." This is also a goal of the revised edition; it does not disappoint. All volumes follow a similar organization. Introductory chapters, written in a narrative style, are usually followed by taxonomic chapters and species accounts, which follow a prescribed format. There are no page references from the main account of the species to the illustrations; the index at the end of each volume must be consulted. Color photographs, illustrations, and distribution maps supplement the text. Additional resources include references to books, periodical articles, organizations, and Web sites.</p><p>Volume 1, <i>Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes</i> (e.g., sea anemones, sponges, jellyfish, flukes, tapeworms, nematodes), and volume 2, <i>Protostomes</i> (e.g., mollusks, gastropods, annelids), represent animals often not well known to nonspecialists. The authors do an excellent job of presenting current research and scientific facts in combination with interesting sidelights. Volume 3, <i>Insects</i>, is written in an engaging style and provides a good overview of more than 1.5 million known species. Volumes 12-16, <i>Mammals</i>, are a rich source of information on this popular group, from platypuses to moles to bats to wildebeests to whales to humans. The illustrations are of mixed appeal; some look like strained imitations of reality, while others seem as if the animals could walk off the page. A less current revision is McGraw-Hill's 1990 <i>Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals</i>, distinguished by exceptional large-format action photographs.</p><p>Authoritative writing in a style accessible to the general reader, comprehensive coverage, a taxonomic arrangement to facilitate comparison between species, consistent organization, ample color illustrations and photographs, incorporation of current research, and the inclusion of conservation status and the significance of the animal to humans make <i>Grzimek's</i> an excellent choice for academic, large public, and special libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this uncompromising account, leading Swiss sociologist Jean Ziegler closely examines the shady relationship between Swiss bankers and Nazi Germany. Based on the records of the German Armaments Ministry and other official documents, The Swiss, the Gold, and the Dead shows how Switzerland's leading financial institutions provided Hittler with the foreign exchange essential to his war effort-laundering gold looted from the banks of occupied Europe and from the bodies of concentration camp victims; granting sizable loans; and supplying Germany's war economy with weapons, ammunition, and precision instruments. In returen, Switzerland was spared the devastation that befell the rest of Europe. Ziegler argues forcefully and authoritatively that without Swiss complicity the war in Europe would have ended earlier, sparing hundreds of thousands of lives. Drawing on more than thirty years of experience in Switzerland's domestic politic and international diplomacy, Professor Ziegler has made an important contribution to this highly controversial and emotional subject.<br></p><p>At what price neutrality? For the 50 years following World War II, Switzerland has maintained that whatever collaboration it may have engaged in with Nazi Germany was undertaken in hopes of avoiding invasion. Recently, however, foreign governments and the families of Holocaust victims have begun to take an interest in the fate of the many millions of dollars' worth of Jewish gold, works of art, and money that disappeared into numbered Swiss bank accounts during the war, never to be seen again. In <i>The Swiss, the Gold, and the Dead</i>, Swiss professor and parliamentarian Jean Ziegler provides a provocative, damning portrait of the Swiss banking community and his fellow countrymen. According to Ziegler, the global financial power that Switzerland now wields is the direct result of the Nazi plunder laundered in Swiss banks, a result that the Swiss people have accepted without guilt or question. It's not surprising that Ziegler's book is controversial in his own country; the Swiss people are understandably reluctant to accept the complicity of their government in funding Hitler's war effort. What <i>is</i> disturbing is the Swiss government's continued attempts to obstruct open discussion of the past. <i>The Swiss, the Gold, and the Dead</i> will certainly make official denials a little bit harder to swallow.Jean Zeigler is a contributor for the following Houghton Mifflin Company Title: The Swiss, The Gold And The Dead</p><h2>Six Encounters with Lincoln: A President Confronts Democracy and Its Demons</h2><p><b>Winner of the Barondess/Lincoln Award from The Civil War Round Table of New York<br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating reading. . .this book eerily reflects some of today&#x2019;s key issues.&#x201d; &#x2013;&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>From an award-winning historian, an engrossing look at how Abraham Lincoln grappled with the challenges of leadership in an unruly democracy</b><br><br> An awkward first meeting with U.S. Army officers, on the eve of the Civil War.

A tense exchange on a navy ship with a Confederate editor and businessman.<br><br> In this eye-opening book, Elizabeth Brown Pryor examines six intriguing, mostly unknown encounters that Abraham Lincoln had with his constituents. Taken together, they reveal his character and opinions in unexpected ways, illustrating his difficulties in managing a republic and creating a presidency. Pryor probes both the political demons that Lincoln battled in his ambitious exercise of power and the demons that arose from the very nature of democracy itself: the clamorous diversity of the populace, with its outspoken demands. She explores the trouble Lincoln sometimes had in communicating and in juggling the multiple concerns that make up being a political leader; how conflicted he was over the problem of emancipation; and the misperceptions Lincoln and the South held about each other. Pryor also provides a fascinating discussion of Lincoln&#x2019;s fondness for storytelling and how he used his skills as a raconteur to enhance both his personal and political power.<br><br> Based on scrupulous research that draws on hundreds of eyewitness letters, diaries, and newspaper excerpts,<i> Six Encounters with Lincoln</i> offers a fresh portrait of Lincoln as the beleaguered politician who was not especially popular with the people he needed to govern with, and who had to deal with the many critics, naysayers, and dilemmas he faced without always knowing the right answer. What it shows most clearly is that greatness was not simply laid on Lincoln&#x2019;s shoulders like a mantle, but was won in fits and starts.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Brown Pryor (1951&#x2013;2015)</b> combined careers as an award-winning historian and a senior diplomat in the American Foreign Service.

Slatten Award for Excellence in Virginia Biography.<p><b>1.&nbsp;A WARY HANDSHAKE</b></p><p><br>Of course it was a dismal day. The sky was as leaden as the national mood. Washington, D.C., had suffered incessant storms that winter, and on March 12, 1861, the roads were sticky with mud from the latest squall. Nervous residents could not help comparing the gloomy weather to the turbulent politics threatening the country. Seven Southern states had left the Union since the election of Abraham Lincoln, forming a new Confederate States of America. The outgoing Buchanan administration had only halfheartedly defended federal property against the secessionists, and efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis were faltering. Now it appeared that the new government was following the same uncertain path. &#x201c;We are a weak, divided, disgraced people, unable to maintain our national existence,&#x201d; the Republican magnat eGeorge Templeton Strong wrote in alarm. The <i>New York Herald</i> agreed. It was a &#x201c;deplorable state of affairs,&#x201d; complained its editors. &#x201c;All joy, all hope, is fled.&#x201d;</p><p>Against this dreary backdrop a curious apparition appeared about midday. At the stolid, neoclassical War Department a large group of military officers in full-dress uniform was assembling, their gold-crested buttons and vivid sashes piercing the dull light. Falling into two columns, they lined up behind Secretary of War Simon Cameron and Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, the Army&#x2019;s venerable chieftain. In perfect formation, they marched to the Executive Mansion along the tree-lined footpath that connected the two buildings. At the door Scott himself solemnly rang the bell. The United States Army had come to call on its new commander in chief.</p><p>By one count, seventy-eight men paraded into the East Room. Such a large group overfilled the space and they began to snake around the perimeter in an undulating line. The officers were resplendent in dark blue frock coats, tall patent leather boots, gilt scabbards, and black-plumed hats. Set against the shabby yellow wallcovering of the &#x201c;nation&#x2019;s parlor,&#x201d; their presence was all the more splendid. It was a &#x201c;spectacular exhibition,&#x201d; noted one of the company; another observert hought he had &#x201c;never seen an equal number of such fine-looking men in uniform.&#x201d; They stood at attention, kid-gloved fingers lightly pressing the stripes of their trousers, silently awaiting the President. After a few moments, Lincoln entered, accompanied by several cabinet members. Some officers had been influenced by newspaper accounts to expect an afternoon of jesting,and now they were surprised. The man before them was as clumsy as his descriptions, but his face was deadly serious.</p><p>The new president had good reason to be grave. Since taking the oath of office on March 4, he had been confronted with multiple crises, sometimes on an hourly basis. Two days into the job, Lincoln learned that the Confederate Congress had called out 100,000 troops to protect its territory. The attorney general and the secretary of war had just informed him that there was no legal way to stop the shipments of arms reportedly being rushed to Charleston, New Orleans, and nearby Baltimore. Samuel Cooper, a New Yorker who had served for a decade as adjutant general of the Army, left his post on March 6 and headed straight forthe Confederate capital&#x2014;taking with him detailed knowledge of personnel, mat�riel, and federal intentions. On March 11 the rebel government adopted a constitution containing elaborate legal justifications for a separate nation. Adelegation from that &#x201c;nation&#x201d; was in Washington at the moment, underinstruction to establish &#x201c;diplomatic ties.&#x201d; Humiliation was in the air, asfederal institutions unraveled and Southern sympathizers sniggered over everything from congressional defections to the disappearance of patent files. Worse yet, the country was broke. When Buchanan&#x2019;s treasury secretary Howell Cobb followed his native state of Georgia out of the Union, he left the nation bankrupt.</p><p>Most pressing was the question of whether to withdraw United States forces from Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. This crisis had been transferred to Lincoln just hours after his inauguration. Since his election, occupation of the fortress had beenan emotional flashpoint: a contest between the South&#x2019;s angry belief that it was no longer governed by consent and Northern determination to protect Union prerogatives and Union property. On March 5 the War Department received a letter from the officer in charge of the garrison, Major Robert Anderson, stating that provisions were nearly exhausted and that Confederate leaders were blockading the harbor, forcing a showdown. Lincoln would have to reinforce the fort or retreat, with all the symbolism that implied.<br><br> The news came as a shock, for Lincoln had wanted to move slowly, to buy time, allay passions, and reassure nervous Unionists south of the Mason-Dixon Line. As president-elect he had tried to downplay the crisis, terming it &#x201c;artificial&#x201d; and claiming there was &#x201c;nothing going wrong.&#x201d; Once he realized that something was going terribly wrong, andthat matters had moved beyond cool reflection, he hoped the separatist fervorwould burn itself out. His deliberative political style would prove a handicap,as every day the situation in Charleston became more perilous. While Lincolntemporized, South Carolina strengthened its defenses. Anderson told hissuperiors he needed twenty thousand soldiers to defend the fort, a numberlarger than the entire standing army. Now he impatiently awaited thePresident&#x2019;s reply. &#x201c;I thought the policy of this new admins. would have beendeveloped by this time,&#x201d; he complained the day before the Army reception,adding that Lincoln&#x2019;s promise to &#x201c;put the foot down firmly&#x201d; against secession appearedeasier said than done. In fact, the President was getting a swift lesson inthe difference between a campaigner&#x2019;s offhand remarks and the grimresponsibility of actually leading the nation through perilous times. Thedilemma had paralyzed his predecessor&#x2014;though Buchanan later claimed he hadstood ready to support Anderson, if only he had been asked. No matter howmeek&#x2014;or even traitorous&#x2014;Buchanan&#x2019;s inaction seemed, Lincoln now found himselfhesitating in just the same manner. &#x201c;Is it possible that Mr. Lincoln is getting scared[?]&#x201d; wrote an influential Illinoisan. &#x201c;I know the responsibility isgrate; But for god sake . . . I don&#x2019;t want to bequeath this damnable questionto any posterity.&#x201d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sumter situation was particularly tricky, for it was not just a question of defending a fort or robustly exerting executive authority. It was coupled with an urgent need to keep those slave states that straddled North and South in the Union.These &#x201c;border states&#x201d; included Missouri, the President&#x2019;s native Kentucky, andthe entire region surrounding the nation&#x2019;s capital. Of these, Virginia was mostsignificant, not only because of its proximity to Washington, but in terms of size, industrial output, and prestige. Maryland, whose communication lineslinked the government to the rest of the nation, was also of criticalimportance. The ties that attached these states to the Union were fraying inMarch 1861, and their leaders made clear that any &#x201c;coercion&#x201d; against the Southwould result in those bonds being cut completely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tension between these two issues&#x2014;the need to restore confidence in the border states,yet firmly uphold federal laws and national dignity&#x2014;had, in fact, been a theme of Lincoln&#x2019;s inaugural address. That had been a tense day, the proceedingsclouded by rumors of Confederate insurrection or attempted assassination.General Scott had summoned all his imposing powers to ensure the newpresident&#x2019;s safety, calling up hundreds of troops to guard the Capitol groundsand personally commanding the sharpshooters placed on adjacent roofs. Lincolnwas not yet master of simple, compelling statements, and his long messageattempted to placate hostility on all sides, while conceding nothing. Despitean emotional appeal to the shared history that bound together the Americanpeople, the laboriously crafted address received a mixed response, both Northand South. &#x201c;Never did an oracle, in its most evasive response, receive so many,and such various interpretations, as did the President&#x2019;s inaugural,&#x201d; observedthe New York Times. Within the military it sparked general dismay. &#x201c;MrLincolns inaugural came to day,&#x201d; wrote an officer named William T. H. Brooks,who was stationed in Texas. &#x201c;If it can appease or quiet the troubled waters itmust bear a different interpretation from what I can give it.&#x201d; At Fort Sumter,officers saw little in the speech to resolve either their dilemma or thenation&#x2019;s. &#x201c;We have just received the inaugural and from it we derive no hope atall that there will be any peaceful settlement,&#x201d; wrote Assistant Surgeon SamuelWylie Crawford, despairing that &#x201c;so many qualifications&#x201d; in the President&#x2019;swords would undermine the address&#x2019;s impact. Soldiers wanted to hear a simpledeclaration of intent, but this speech smacked of equivocation. &#x201c;A steel handin a soft glove&#x201d; was how Major Samuel Heintzelman described it, a few daysbefore stepping into the East Room to greet the President. &#x201c;I fear it will leadto Civil War.&#x201d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sumter issue pressed on Lincoln to the point that he was physically ill, losing sleep and suffering chronic headaches. Before the end of that tempestuous March, his wife reported he had keeled over from worry and fatigue. One of his aides referred to those days as &#x201c;the terrible furnace time,&#x201d; when public anxiety was stoked to the limit, and old patterns of governing melted away in the political fire. Lincoln wanted desperately to avoid appearing as stymied as Buchanan yet found himself unable to formulate a decisive policy. He later told Orville Hickman Browning, a Republican ally, that all the &#x201c;troubles and anxieties of his life had not equaled&#x201d; those he faced during the Sumter crisis.</p></p><h2>Perla Meyer&#39;s Art of Seasonal Cooking</h2><p>Though it may be possible to serve apples in April, watermelon in January, and &#34;fresh&#34; snow peas any time at all--the wisdom and joyof true seasonal cookin g prevails.

Decorative line art throughout.</p><p>Eighteen years after her first book, the well-regarded Perla Meyers' Seasonal Kitchen, and 12 years since her last major one, Perla Meyers' From Market to Kitchen Cookbook, this Spanish-born American author is still extolling local seasonal produce but also drawing on the global pantry that has become available in the interim. The present collection, still seasonally arranged, embraces both old-fashioned and nouvelle concepts, owes much to French and Italian motifs, and tends to company fare, dressed up in sauces, ``marmalades'' (not necessarily sweet or fruity), and various mixed toppings and trimmings. But none of this is tricky or elaborate, nor are Meyers's combinations capricious. Her hefty compilation of dishes, from soy-sauced black-bean salad or double- squash soup to roasted red-pepper quiche or veal medallions with chanterelles and apples, is well timed to meet an emerging demand for dishes that are original but not outr&#x201a; and meals that are a little more formal than the snappy, emphatic features of the 80's but lighter and easier than the gourmet clunkers of a generation past. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The first police officers to arrive there had made sure that it would remain untouched.</p><p>The hotel manager had asked them not to cause a fracas. Used that phrase when he rang. This was a hotel and hotels thrive on their reputations, and he asked them to take that into account. So there were no sirens outside, nor uniformed policemen bursting in through the lobby. The manager said that at all costs they should avoid arousing fear among the guests.</p><p>Iceland mustn&#x2019;t be too exciting, too much of an adventure.</p><p>Now he was standing next to El�nborg and greeted Erlendur and Sigurdur �li with a handshake. He was so fat that his suit hardly encompassed his body. His jacket was done up across the stomach by one button that was on the verge of giving up. The top of his trousers was hidden beneath a huge paunch that bulged out of his jacket and the man sweated so furiously that he could never put away the large white handkerchief with which he mopped his forehead and the back of his neck at regular intervals. The white collar of his shirt was soaked in perspiration. Erlendur shook his clammy hand.</p><p>&#x2018;Thank you,&#x2019; the hotel manager said, puffing like a grampus. In his twenty years of managing the hotel he had never encountered anything like this.</p><p>&#x2018;In the middle of the Christmas rush,&#x2019; he groaned. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t understand how this could happen! How could it happen?&#x2019; he repeated, leaving them in no doubt as to how totally perplexed he was.</p><p>&#x2018;Is he up or down?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Up or down?&#x2019; the fat manager puffed. &#x2018;Do you mean whether he&#x2019;s gone to heaven?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s exactly what we need to know...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we take the lift upstairs?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked.</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; the manager said, casting an irritated look at Erlendur. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s down here in the basement. He&#x2019;s got a little room there. We didn&#x2019;t want to chuck him out. And then you get this for your troubles.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Why would you have wanted to chuck him out?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>The hotel manager looked at him but did not reply.</p><p>They walked slowly down the stairs beside the lift. The manager went first. Going down the stairs was a strain for him and Erlendur wondered how he would get back up.</p><p>Apart from Erlendur, they had agreed to show a certain amount of consideration, to try to approach the hotel as discreetly as possible. Three police cars were parked at the back, with an ambulance. Police officers and paramedics had gone in through the back door. The district medical officer was on his way. He would certify the death and call out a van to transport the body.</p><p>They walked down a long corridor with the panting manager leading the way. Plain-clothes policemen greeted them. The corridor grew darker the further they walked, because the light bulbs on the ceiling had blown and no one had bothered to change them. Eventually, in the darkness, they reached the door, which opened onto a little room. It was more like a storage space than a dwelling, but there was a narrow bed inside, a small desk and a tattered mat on the dirty tiled floor. There was a little window up near the ceiling.</p><p>The man was sitting on the bed, leaning against the wall. He was wearing a bright red Santa suit and still had the Santa cap on his head, but it had slipped down over his eyes. A large artificial Santa beard hid his face. He had undone the thick belt around his waist and unbuttoned his jacket. Beneath it he was wearing only a white vest. There was a fatal wound to his heart. Although there were other wounds on the body, the stabbing through the heart had finished him off. His hands had slash marks on them, as if he had tried to fight off the assailant. His trousers were down round his ankles. A condom hung from his penis.</p><p>&#x2018;Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li warbled, looking down at the body.</p><p>El�nborg hushed him.</p><p>In the room was a small wardrobe and the door was open. It contained folded trousers and sweaters, ironed shirts, underwear and socks. A uniform hung on a coat-hanger, navy blue with golden epaulettes and shiny brass buttons. A pair of smartly-polished black leather shoes stood beside the cupboard.</p><p>Newspapers and magazines were strewn over the floor. Beside the bed was a small table and lamp. On the table was a single book: A History of the Vienna Boys&#x2019; Choir.</p><p>&#x2018;Did he live here, this man?&#x2019; Erlendur asked as he surveyed the scene. He and El�nborg had entered the room. Sigurdur �li and the hotel manager were standing outside. It was too small for them all inside.</p><p>&#x2018;We let him stay here,&#x2019; the manager said awkwardly, mopping the sweat from his brow. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s been working for us for donkey&#x2019;s years. Since before my time. As a doorman.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was the door open when he was found?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked, trying to be formal, as if to compensate for his little ditty.</p><p>&#x2018;I asked her to wait for you,&#x2019; the manager said. &#x2018;The girl who found him. She&#x2019;s in the staff coffee room. Gave her quite a shock, poor thing, as you can imagine.&#x2019; The manager avoided looking into the room.</p><p>Erlendur walked up to the body and peered at the wound to the heart. He had no idea what kind of blade had killed the man. He looked up. Above the bed was an old, faded poster for a Shirley Temple film, sellotaped at the corners. Erlendur didn&#x2019;t know the film. It was called The Little Princess. The poster was the only decoration in the room.</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked from the doorway as he looked at the poster.</p><p>&#x2018;It says on it,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Shirley Temple.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that then? Is she dead?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s Shirley Temple?&#x2019; El�nborg was astonished at Sigurdur �li&#x2019;s ignorance. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you know who she was? Didn&#x2019;t you study in America?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was she a Hollywood star?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked, still looking at the poster.</p><p>&#x2018;She was a child star,&#x2019; Erlendur said curtly. &#x2018;So she&#x2019;s dead in a sense anyway.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Eh?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, failing to grasp the remark.</p><p>&#x2018;A child star,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;I think she&#x2019;s still alive. I don&#x2019;t remember. I think she&#x2019;s something with the United Nations.&#x2019;</p><p>It dawned on Erlendur that there were no other personal effects in the room. He looked around but could see no bookshelf, CDs or computer, no radio or television. Only a desk, chair, wardrobe and bed with a scruffy pillow and dirty duvet cover. The little room reminded him of a prison cell.</p><p>He went out into the corridor and peered into the darkness at the far end, and could make out a faint smell of burning, as if someone had been playing with matches there or possibly lighting their way.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s down there?&#x2019; he asked the manager.</p><p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he replied and looked up at the ceiling. &#x2018;Just the end of the corridor. A couple of bulbs have gone. I&#x2019;ll have that fixed.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How long had he lived here, this man?&#x2019; Erlendur asked as he went back into the room.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, since before my time.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So he was here when you became the manager?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Are you telling me he lived in this hole for twenty years?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>El�nborg looked at the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;At least he practised safe sex,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>&#x2018;Not safe enough,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>At that point the district medical officer arrived, accompanied by a member of the hotel staff who then went back along the corridor. The medical officer was very fat too, although nowhere near a match for the hotel manager. When he squeezed into the room, El�nborg darted back out for air.</p><p>&#x2018;Hello, Erlendur,&#x2019; the medical officer said.</p><p>&#x2018;What does it look like?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Heart attack, but I need a better look,&#x2019; replied the medical officer, who was known for his appalling sense of humour.</p><p>Erlendur looked out at Sigurdur �li and El�nborg, who were grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>&#x2018;Do you know when it happened?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t be very long ago. Some time during the last two hours. He&#x2019;s hardly begun to go cold. Have you located his reindeer?&#x2019;</p><p>Erlendur groaned.</p><p>The medical officer lifted his hand from the body.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll sign the certificate,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;You send it to the mortuary and they&#x2019;ll open him up there. They say that orgasm is a kind of moment of death,&#x2019; he added, looking down at the body. &#x2018;So he had a double.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A double?&#x2019; Erlendur didn&#x2019;t understand him.</p><p>&#x2018;Orgasm, I mean,&#x2019; the medical officer said. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll take photographs, won&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said.</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ll look nice in his family album.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t appear to have any family,&#x2019; Erlendur said and looked around the room again. &#x2018;So you&#x2019;re done for the time being?&#x2019; he asked, eager to put an end to the wisecracks.</p><p>The district medical officer nodded, squeezed back out of the room and went down the corridor.</p><p>&#x2018;Won&#x2019;t we have to close down the hotel?&#x2019; El�nborg asked, and noticed the manager gasp at her question. &#x2018;Stop all traffic in and out. Question everyone staying here and all the staff? Close the airports. Stop ships leaving port...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For God&#x2019;s sake,&#x2019; the manager groaned, squeezing his handkerchief with an imploring look at Erlendur. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s only the doorman!&#x2019;</p><p>Mary and Joseph would never have been given a room here, Erlendur thought to himself.</p><p>&#x2018;This...this...filth has nothing to do with my guests,&#x2019; the manager spluttered with indignation. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re tourists, almost all of them, and regional people, businessmen and the like. No one who has anything to do with the doorman. No one. This is one of the largest hotels in Reykjav�k. It&#x2019;s packed over the holidays. You can&#x2019;t just close it down! You just can&#x2019;t!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We could, but we won&#x2019;t,&#x2019; Erlendur said, trying to calm the manager down. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll need to question some of the guests and most of the staff, I expect.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Thank God,&#x2019; the manager sighed, regaining his composure.</p><p>&#x2018;What was the man&#x2019;s name?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Gudlaugur,&#x2019; the manager said. &#x2018;I think he&#x2019;s around fifty. And you&#x2019;re right about his family, I don&#x2019;t think he has any.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who visited him?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t got a clue,&#x2019; the manager puffed.</p><p>&#x2018;Has anything unusual happened at the hotel involving this man?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Theft?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. Nothing&#x2019;s happened.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Complaints?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He hasn&#x2019;t become embroiled in anything that could explain this?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not as far as I know.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was he involved in any conflicts with anyone at this hotel?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not that I know of.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Outside the hotel?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not that I know of but I don&#x2019;t know him very well. Didn&#x2019;t,&#x2019; the manager corrected himself.</p><p>&#x2018;Not after twenty years?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, not really. He wasn&#x2019;t very sociable, I don&#x2019;t think. Kept himself to himself as much as he could.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you think a hotel is the right place for a man like him?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Me? I don&#x2019;t know...He was always very polite and there were never really any complaints about him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Never really?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, there were never any complaints about him. He wasn&#x2019;t a bad worker really.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the staff coffee room?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x2019; The hotel manager mopped his brow, relieved that they would not close the hotel.</p><p>&#x2018;Did he have guests?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; the manager said.</p><p>&#x2018;Guests,&#x2019; Erlendur repeated. &#x2018;It looks like someone who knew him was here, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x2019;</p><p>The manager looked at the body and his eyes dwelled on the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know anything about his girlfriends,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Nothing at all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t know very much about this man,&#x2019; Erlendur said.</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s a doorman here,&#x2019; the manager said, and felt that Erlendur should accept that by way of explanation.</p><p>They left the room. The forensics team went in with their equipment and more officers followed them. It was difficult for them all to squeeze their way past the manager. Erlendur asked them to examine the corridor carefully and the dark alcove further down. Sigurdur �li and El�nborg stood inside the little room observing the body.</p><p>&#x2018;I wouldn&#x2019;t like to be found like that,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s no concern of his any more,&#x2019; El�nborg said.</p><p>&#x2018;No, probably not,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;Is there anything in it?&#x2019; El�nborg asked as she took out a little bag of salted peanuts. She was always nibbling at things. Sigurdur �li thought it was because of nerves.</p><p>&#x2018;In it?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>She nodded in the direction of the body. After staring at her for a moment, Sigurdur �li realised what she meant. He hesitated, then knelt down by the body and stared at the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s empty.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So she killed him before his orgasm,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;The doctor thought&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, isn&#x2019;t that obvious?&#x2019; El�nborg said, emptying a handful of peanuts into her mouth. She offered some to Sigurdur �li, who declined. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t there something tarty about it? He&#x2019;s had a woman in here,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Hasn&#x2019;t he?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the simplest theory,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, standing up.</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t think so?&#x2019; El�nborg said.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t have the faintest idea.&#x2019;</p><p>VOICES Copyright � 2003 by Arnaldur Indridason</p></p><h2>The Revolution of Marina M.: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the mega-bestselling author of <i>White Oleander </i>and <i>Paint It Black</i>, a sweeping historical saga of the Russian Revolution, as seen through the eyes of one young woman</b><b><br></b><b>One of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Must-Read Books of Fall 2017</b><b>A <i>PopSugar </i>Favorite Book of 2017<br></b><br>St. Petersburg, New Year's Eve, 1916.

Though it's been fairly well settled that our species was born in Africa, the debate still rages over our hometown. <i>In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins</i> is a beautifully written argument in favor of the southern end of the continent rather than the eastern locations more popular among paleoanthropologists. Author Lee R. Berger's discovery and analysis of 117,000-year-old fossilized footprints of modern humans in South Africa, as well as a wealth of other fossils and artifacts, point to a speciation event in the unique ecosystem found along the Cape. His tells his story lyrically, and the rich descriptions of his finds and reconstructions of past events conjure strong imagery in the reader's mind; unfortunately, the book must rely on these descriptions since illustrations are sparse. Using clear, careful language, Berger explains the differing theories of recent human evolution, how his differs from the Leakey-Johansen model cradling <i>H. sapiens</i> near the Horn of Africa, and where the argument stands as of his writing in early 2000. Capturing the excitement of fossil hunting, the frustration of challenging established authority, and the sheer delight of scientific pursuit, <i>In the Footsteps of Eve</i> finds the mystery of life in ancient dust and rocks. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Popular books on human evolution abound. Berger, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, enters this competitive field with an engaging volume that discusses the fossils every bit as much as the scientists who discover them and interpret their meanings. Scientifically, Berger stakes out controversial new territory in claiming that the prevalent hypothesis that humans first arose in East Africa is false. Instead, he argues that the evidence points to South Africa as the original birthplace of our species. Furthermore, he asserts that Lucy, the famous fossil long thought to be one of our ancestors, is instead a member of a species on a terminal side branch of the evolutionary tree. While the average reader is in no position to determine whether Berger's views are correct, the information he presents is comprehensive and accessible. Berger also impressively demonstrates how, in the highly competitive field of human origins, large hypotheses based on small pieces of evidence can arise from preconceived biases as much as compelling data. Although his writing is occasionally clumsy and he casts himself in a larger role than his accomplishments warrant to date, Berger offers a great deal of absorbing material in this first-person account; this book is sure to entice those interested in human origins.

Why aren't more radio dramas like this? Perhaps because it's hard to write comedy as polished as Jonathan Lynn's and Antony Jay's in this classic British satire following a new government minister as he butts up against the entrenched civil service and the realities of political life. It's hard to tell who is being most severely critiqued. Is it complacent civil servants? Shallow, ignorant elected officials? The British public, who allow all this to go on? Thankfully, listeners don't have to decide. Instead, they can enjoy Paul Eddington's wonderful timing as Jim Hacker, Nigel Hawthorne's supercilious characterization of Sir Humphrey Appleby, and Derek Fowlds's precise portrait of Bernard Wooley. G.T.B. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>The British TV series Yes Minister (shown here on PBS) began as an innocuous spoof on the vagaries of politicians and civil servants. Its popularity increased as it developed a deepening satiric perception of how the British are actually governed: Ministers are kept in the dark by their civil service advisers as much as possible; their sole domain is "making policy," while the civil servants get on with running the country and making sure the politicians get the blame. In turning their scripts into a book, the authors have gone beyond a simple recounting of the episodes. Presented as actual memoirsthe diary of James Hacker, Minister for the Department of Administrative Affairs, augmented by material from his two civil service advisers, Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard WooleyYes Minister is an amusingly literate, sharply satirical account of the exchanges of quid pro quo necessary to run any government. The book surpasses its TV origins and stands firmly on its own merits. On the bestseller lists in England for over three years, this provocative satire could well be considered a British Doonesbury. 25,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The MacGregors: Serena ~ Caine: Playing The OddsTempting Fate</h2><p>The MacGregors: Serena and Caine by Nora Roberts released on Dec 27, 2005 is available now for purchase.</p><p>In the wake of the success of <i>The MacGregor Brides</i> and <i>The MacGregor Grooms</i>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts has repackaged and reissued the sagas of earlier generations, beginning with Serena and Caine, daughter and son of family patriarch Daniel MacGregor. Daniel's romantic machinations embroil Serena and Caine with another brother and sister team, Justin and Diana Blade. In <i>Playing the Odds</i>, Comanche gambler Justin Blade finds himself on a vacation cruise to the Bahamas where he is instantly attracted to a violet-eyed casino dealer. Only later does he learn that the lissome Serena is one and the same as the much-degreed Rena MacGregor, daughter of his longtime silent business partner, Daniel MacGregor. Serena makes it her practice to never get involved with gamblers, but the predatory gaze of Justin Blade steals her breath and steels her resolve to ignore his overtures. When Justin makes her an offer she can't refuse--the position of casino manager in his Atlantic City hotel-casino--Serena finds herself drawn to the man who worked his way up from nowhere, never swerving in his pursuit of financial success and possession of Serena. In this contemporary drama, the house (and the heart) always wins! Once settled as Justin's partner in business and in life, Serena invites Justin's sister Diana to visit. To Diana, Justin is the beloved older brother who abandoned her 20 years earlier, after their mother's death, leaving Diana to be raised by her cold Aunt Adelaide who demanded absolute obedience from her. Now a Harvard-educated lawyer in Boston, Diana is a cool operator, her emotions packed tightly away, until Caine MacGregor, her new sister-in-law's brother and infamous rogue of Harvard Law's ivied halls, greets her at the airport on her visit to get to know the brother she loved so long ago. Diana finds herself in turmoil, trying to deal with her hurt and anger toward her brother and the attraction that she feels for Caine who just happens to be near whenever Diana's well-guarded shell cracks. Caine works inexorably to overcome the much-exaggerated tales of his law school peccadilloes, slowly changing Diana's mind about his playboy reputation and teaching her to trust her heart and him. No one builds romantic tension better than Nora Roberts; even the second (or third or fourth) reading is every bit as exciting as the first! <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>Nora Roberts is the bestselling author of more than two hundred romance novels. She was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame.

There are no children to play with, and his parents sit "still as stone." But a visit next door soon changes all that, because Pierre is lucky enough to have as neighbors surrealist artist Rene Magritte and his wife, Georgette. On this particular day the Magrittes' friend Salvador Dali is invited to dinner, and an exciting affair it is-flying fish soup and partridge pie (the fish really leap and the birds still fly!). And before dinner, Pierre finds himself occupied with a croquet game (with a limp mallet) and a dash through the rain (cats and dogs tumble from the sky). Garland's droll text ("Did you dilly, Dali?") is complemented by Magritte-style oil paintings filled, appropriately, with surrealist images: Magritte's bowler hats, Dali's melted clocks, etc. A useful note sets Magritte and Dali (and Garland) in context. Paying tribute to the magic of surrealist art and to the ever-active imagination, this work is eerie, fun and inspiring. Ages 6-9. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-6?Pierre, a curious French youngster, relieves the boredom of a weekend in the country with his stodgy parents by visiting the couple next door, Rene and Georgette Magritte. And guess who happens to drop in for dinner? Salvador Dali. The text is brief and without character. In keeping with the spirit of surrealism, the events of the day are mundane?a walk in the woods, a croquet game, charades, etc.?while the way the happenings are depicted is anything but ordinary. The full-page oil paintings that tell the visual tale are based on the work of the 20th-century Belgian artist who sets the tone when he tells his young friend, "Anyone can try to paint what they see. I like to paint what I think. I paint what I dream." Thus, the fun is in searching out and puzzling over the odd bits or laughing at the literal representation of "it started to rain cats and dogs." The illustrations are true to the spirit of the originals and are a soft-sell approach to art appreciation.?Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sweethearts of Rhythm: The Story of the Greatest All-Girl Swing Band in the World</h2><p>In the 1940s, as the world was at war, a remarkable jazz band performed on the American home front. This all-female band, originating from a boarding school in the heart of Mississippi, found its way to the most famous ballrooms in the country, offering solace during the hard years of the war. They dared to be an interracial group despite the cruelties of Jim Crow laws, and they dared to assert their talents though they were women in a ?man?s? profession. Told in thought-provoking poems and arresting images, this unusual look at our nation?s history is deep and inspiring.</p><p>Marilyn Nelson is a three-time National Book Award Finalist, has won a Newbery Honor, a Printz Honor and several Coretta Scott King Honors, and has received several prestigious poetry awards, including the Poets&#39; Prize and the Robert Frost Medal. She has recently been a judge of poetry applicants at the National Endowment for the Arts and Yaddo, and has received three honorary doctorates.Starred Review. Grade 4 Up&#x2014;Nelson's syncopated poetry jives perfectly with Pinkney's layered watercolors in this look at the famous all-girl African-American swing band that toured the U.S., breaking attendance records, from 1937 to 1946. Nelson speaks in the voices of the band's instruments, reminiscing about their glory days from the shelves of a New Orleans pawnshop, recalling the excitement of the road and the difficulties of Jim Crow. Her poetry evokes the rich wail of swing music with varied meters, rhyme schemes, and free verse, calling up memories of the Dust Bowl, World War II, rationing, segregation, and music that momentarily lifted its listeners above hardship. Pinkney employs graphite, color pencil, watercolor, and collage in lusciously hued illustrations depicting night clubs, dancers, Victory Gardens, marching soldiers, and musicians in a vibrant volume that will be just as useful in high school history and English classrooms as for upper elementary general reading, not to mention music and art at any level. A chronology of the Sweethearts' history enhances the poetry.&#x2014;<i>Joyce Adams Burner, National Archives at Kansas City, MO</i> END</p><h2>The Secret Club (Sweet Pickles)</h2><p>While all the other animals of Sweet Pickles are learning to swim, Vain Vulture is interested only in showing off his new bathing suit.</p><p></p><h2>South</h2><p>When a little bird awakens to find that all of his friends and family have gone south for the winter, it takes a surprising friendship with Mooch the cat to help him find his way. This is a wordless and profoundly moving story--by the creator of the beloved comic strip <em>Mutts</em>--that explores being lost and found, crossing boundaries, saying goodbye, and broadening horizons.</p><p>Patrick McDonnell is the creator of the <em>Mutts</em> comic strip, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary. He has illustrated for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, <em>Reader's Digest</em>, <em>Time</em>, <em>Parents</em>, and other journals, done CD covers for the Greatest Hits classical music series, and created a license plate for his home state of New Jersey.

He is the author of <em>The Gift of Nothing</em>, <em>Art</em>, <em>Just Like Heaven</em>, and <em>Hug Time, </em>and the co-author of <em>Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman</em>.Starred Review. PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;McDonnell has composed another quiet gem. Literally. The sole sounds are birdsong, weeping, and snoring; the only words appear on signs: "South" and "Walk." The season is fall, and the chorus comes from a flock perched in a nearly bare tree. In the next instant, the birds lift off, and, as the pages turn, the last leaf drops, bonking a slumbering bird on the head at the base of the tree. Anyone who has every experienced the thought of being abandoned or feeling lost will relate to the utterly convincing panic conveyed in the artist's expressive watercolors and emotive lines as it dawns on this tiny creature that he has been left behind. Yet, he is not alone. Enter Mooch, the feline protagonist from the artist's comic strip "Mutts." He offers a hand, leading and carrying his young charge through rural and urban landscapes, until the birds are joyfully reunited. McDonnell's comfort with unfilled expanses, his beautifully balanced compositions, and the nature of his brushwork evoke the feel of traditional Chinese art. Tan recycled paper provides warmth in keeping with this tender, compact story. While it will be enjoyed universally, be sure to place it where nonreaders will find it, and remember it when asked for a Good Samaritan story. Its subtle sweetness is a rare and wonderful thing.&#x2014;<i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He spent his free time reading stacks of flying magazines, building model airplanes, and staring through the homemade telescope mounted on the roof of his neighbor&#39;s garage. As a teenager, Neil became obsessed with the idea of flight, working odd jobs to pay for flying lessons at a nearby airport. He earned his student pilot&#39;s license on his sixteenth birthday. But who was to know that this shy boy, who also loved books and music, would become the first person to set foot on the moon, on July 20, 1969. Here is the inspiring story of one boy&#39;s dream - a dream of flying that landed him more than 200,000 miles away in space, gazing upon the awesome sight of a tiny earth hanging suspended in a perfectly black sky. On the thirtieth anniversary of the moon landing, Don Brown&#39;s expressive story reveals the achievement of this American legend, Neil Armstrong, re</p><p>Don Brown is the award-winning author and illustrator of many picture book biographies. He has been widely praised for his resonant storytelling and his delicate watercolor paintings that evoke the excitement, humor, pain, and joy of lives lived with passion. School Library Journal has called him &#x201c;a current pacesetter who has put the finishing touches on the standards for storyographies.&#x201d; He lives in New York with his family.Fans of Alice Ramsey's Grand Adventure may wish that Brown had likewise dedicated this picture book to the singular ride that made history for his subject. Instead, the author's informal chronicle of astronaut Armstrong's life focuses primarily on his childhood, then skips ahead to his milestone flight in the final spreads. The book opens in 1932, when two-year-old Neil, perched on his father's shoulders, watches airplanes race. Readers next see him four years later, riding in a plane for the first time, an experience that inspires a "magical dream" in which he "held his breath and hovered above the ground." Young Neil makes model airplanes, reads Air Travel magazine, peers at the moon through a neighbor's telescope and eventually begins flying lessons. But Armstrong's training to become an astronaut and his career leading up to the 1969 flight to the moon get less emphasis. And the conclusion is a bit ethereal (after he stepped onto the moon, he "became a hero to millions of people. But inside him was the memory of an ordinary boy.... A boy who loved books and music....A boy who dreamed of hanging in the air suspended only by a trapped breath." Similarly sketchy, Brown's airy, pen-and-ink and watercolor art does little to get this spotty biography off the ground.

It is today one of the most popular literary genres, but not long ago, readers would have been hard-pressed even to find memoir sections in their favorite bookstores. Hampl, who herself is a memoirist of note (<i>A Romantic Education</i> and <i>Virgin Time</i>) opens the book with some of her own memories. She recalls a bus trip during the Vietnam War era to visit her "draft resister" boyfriend in jail. When the bus stops along the way in a small town, she notices a large, middle-age woman passionately kissing a very handsome, much younger man, or is it the other way around? The woman boards the bus while the young man runs along outside, blowing her kisses. She takes the seat next to Hampl and says with a sigh, "I could tell you stories."<p> This small event sets the stage for the rest of the book--it draws a narrative out of a mostly mundane moment and underscores the complicated nature of remembering events as they actually happened. She writes that because "everyone 'has' a memoir, we all have a stake in how such stories are told. For we do not, after all, simply <i>have</i> experience; we are entrusted with it." In the balance of the book, Hampl examines the autobiographical writings of St. Augustine, Anne Frank, Sylvia Plath, Edith Stein, and Czeslaw Milosz. In each instance, she attempts to uncover the writer's intentions and reveal the true secrets that lurk in the shadows of what's on the page. <i>I Could Tell You Stories</i> is an excellent investigation into what makes a story essentially worthy of being told and ultimately read--a good companion to whatever book is currently in your hands. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>Patricia Hampl lives in St. Paul, where she is Regents&#39; Professor at the University of Minnesota. Patricia Hampl is the author of two highly acclaimed memoirs, A Romantic Education, to be reissued in paperback by Norton, and Virgin Time. Her last three books have been New York Times Notable Books of the Year.

No signs of wear, tight hard cover binding. STORIES TO GO!Sylvester the donkey finds a magic pebble and unthinkingly wishes himself turned into a rock when he&#39;s frightened by a lion. How Sylvester is eventually reunited with his loving parents is a tender, magical tale of the transforming power of love. This Caldecott Medal-winning book is a modern classic beloved by children everywhere.</p><p>Imagine all the happiness and wealth you could achieve if you found a magic pebble that granted your every wish! Sylvester Duncan, an unassuming donkey who collects pebbles "of unusual shape and color," experiences just such a lucky find. But before he can make all his wishes come true, the young donkey unexpectedly encounters a mean-looking lion. Startled, Sylvester wishes he were a rock, but in mineral form he can no longer hold the pebble, and thus cannot wish himself back to his equine trappings. His parents, thinking he has disappeared, are at first frantic, then miserable, and then plunge into donkey ennui. Meanwhile, Sylvester is gravely depressed, but tries to get used to being a rock.<p> In 1970, William Steig won the Caldecott Medal for <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>--the first of his many Newbery and Caldecott honors. In this donkey's tale, Steig imbues his characteristically simple illustrations of animals sporting human garb with evocative, irresistible, and heartbreakingly vivid emotions. The text is straightforward and the dialogue remarkably touching. Children will feel deeply for Sylvester and his parents, all wishing for the impossible--that the family will one day be reunited. Sylvester's sweet story is one that endures, reminding us all that sometimes what we have is all we really need. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>On a rainy day, Sylvester finds a magic pebble that can make wishes come true. But when a lion frightens him on his way home, Sylvester makes a wish that brings unexpected results. How Sylvester is eventually reunited with his loving family and restored to his true self makes a story that is beautifully tender and filled with true magic. Illustrated with William Steig's glowing pictures, this is a modern classic beloved by children everywhere. <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i> is a winner of the Caldecott Medal.END</p><h2>The Brontes: Wild Genius on the Moors: The Story of a Literary Family</h2><p><p><strong>In a revised and updated edition, the real story of the Bront� sisters, by distinguished scholar and historian Juliet Barker.</strong></p><p>The story of the tragic Bront� family is familiar to everyone: we all know about the half-mad, repressive father, the drunken, drug-addicted wastrel of a brother, wildly romantic Emily, unrequited Anne, and &#x201c;poor Charlotte.&#x201d; Or do we?

The doomsday of Ragnarok will cause a jolt of disquiet among those who are used to Hollywood endings, and Thor himself will be a surprise for those who are familiar with Hollywood Thor&#x2014;but those surprises are often where the fun lies. Fans more well-versed in Norse myths should still appreciate the humor and spark that Gaiman infuses into the stories he has selected to retell, adding to the existing rich literature. Many who read <em>Norse Mythology</em> will make this volume their joyful leaping-off point into a strange and mesmerizing world of gods, giants, undead goats, betrayals, a slanderous squirrel, elves, dwarves, and Valkyries. And don't forget that ship made of the finger- and toenails of the dead. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em><p>Neil Gaiman is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the novels <em>Neverwhere, Stardust, American Gods, Coraline, Anansi Boys, The Graveyard Book, Good Omens</em> (with Terry Pratchett), <em>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</em>, and <em>The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains</em>; the Sandman series of graphic novels; and the story collections <em>Smoke and Mirrors</em>, <em>Fragile Things</em>, and <em>Trigger Warning</em>.

Not since Saint Augustine wrote "Give me chastity, Lord -- but not yet!" has anyone brought such smart-assed hilarity to a conversion story.</p><p>Karr's battle is grounded in common loss (a bitter romance, friends' deaths, a teenage son's leaving home) as well as in elegies for a complicated mother. The poems disarm with the arresting humor familiar to readers of her memoirs, <em>The Liars' Club and Cherry</em>. An illuminating cycle of spiritual poems have roots in Karr's eight-month tutelage in Jesuit prayer practice, and as an afterword, her celebrated essay on faith weaves the tale of how the language of poetry, which relieved her suffering so young, eventually became the language of prayer. Those of us who fret that poetry denies consolation will find clear-eyed joy in this collection.</p></p><p><p>In her fourth collection of poems, self-described black-belt sinner Mary Karr traces her improbable journey from the inferno of a tormented childhood into a resolutely irreverent Catholicism.

These twenty-three prose poems are thoughtprovoking, witty, and thoroughly unexpected observations of a bygone era, and through the lens of Feinstein's camera they speak volumes about the faces and places that have graced the City of Angels. Images like those of Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, and Steve McQueen resonate with our collective memory, while photographs of hopeful starlets, movie studio backlots, and sunny, palm tree'd boulevards evoke the timeless allure of all things Hollywood.<p><i>Hollywood Foto-Rhetoric</i> marks a unique collaboration: With his unerring eye, Barry Feinstein captured unforgettable moments in stunning black-and-white, such as Marilyn Monroe's swimming pool on the day she died, and Frank Sinatra celebrating at John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Ball. In the provocative accompanying text, Bob Dylan's quixotic, expressive lyricism redefines silver screen nostalgia.</p></p><p><b>Bob Dylan</b> is one of the most lauded and greatest loved songwriters and performers of all time.

PH.D. , scribe TO THE messenger.</p><p><i>The Book.</i></p><p>The full title of this book is &#x201c;The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the Christ of the Piscean Age,&#x201d; and the critical reader is apt to ask a number of pertinent questions concerning it. Among the many anticipated questions these are perhaps the most important:</p><p>1. What is an Age?</p><p>2. What is the Piscean Age?</p><p>3. What is the Aquarian Age?</p><p>4. What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?</p><p>5. What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?</p><p>6. Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?</p><p>7. What are the Akashic Records?</p><p></p><p><i><b>1.</b> What is an Age?</i> Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family of planets revolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles distant, and that it requires something less than 26,000 years to make one revolution. His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into twelve signs, familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. It requires our Solar System a little more than 2,100 years to pass through one of these signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age or Dispensation. Because of what Astronomers call &#x201c;the precession of the Equinoxes&#x201d; the movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac is in order reverse from that given above.</p><p><i>Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age</i>. Regarding this matter there is a disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are not called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for their opinions; there are enough well authenticated facts for our present purposes. It is conceded by all critical students that the sun entered the zodiacal sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when the Taurian Age began; that Abraham lived not far from the beginning of the Arian Age, when the sun entered the sign Aries. About the time of the rise of the Roman empire the sun entered the sign Pisces, the Fishes, and the Piscean Age began, so that early in this Age Jesus of Nazareth lived.</p><p><i><b>2.</b> What is the Piscean Age?</i> This question requires further consideration. The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian Dispensation. The word Pisces means fish. The sign is known as a water sign, and the Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the fish and its element, water.</p><p>In the establishment of their great institutions John the Harbinger and Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been used in some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults, even to the present time. Water is the true symbol of purification. Jesus himself said to the Harbinger before he was baptized: &#x201c;All men must be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul.&#x201d; (Aquarian Gospel 64:7.)</p><p><i>Fish was a Christian Symbol</i>. In the earlier centuries of the Christian Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol. In his remarkable book, &#x201c;Christian Iconography,&#x201d; Didron says:</p><p>&#x201c;The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol of Jesus Christ. The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian monuments, and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi. It is also upon medals, bearing the name of our Savior and also upon engraved stones, cameos and intaglios. The fish is also to be remarked upon the amulets worn suspended from the necks by children, and upon ancient glasses and sculptured lamps.</p><p>&#x201c;Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish. The fish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the table, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at the banquet.&#x201d;</p><p>In the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: &#x201c;We are little fishes in Christ our great fish.&#x201d;</p><p>The last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly been one of water and the many uses of that element have been emphasized, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to a high degree of efficiency.</p><p><i><b>3.</b> What is the Aquarian Age?</i> The human race is today standing upon the cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the New Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air, electricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea, and send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of lightning.</p><p>The word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning water. Aquarius is, however, the <i>water bearer</i>, and the symbol of the sign, which is the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his right hand a pitcher of water. Jesus referred to the beginning of the Aquarian Age in these words:</p><p>&#x201c;And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an arc of heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in the eastern sky. The wise will then lift up their heads and know that the redemption of the earth is near.&#x201d; (Aquarian Gospel 157:29, 30.)</p><p>The Aquarian Age is pre-eminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual side of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be comprehended by multitudes of people for the many are now coming into an advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety this book is called &#x201c;The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the Christ.&#x201d;</p><p><i>An Important Event</i>. The transfer of dominion from one Age to another is an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim. Among the manuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper describing the transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian Age, but it is difficult to determine whether it is a recital of facts or a prophetic statement. We reproduce the paper in full.</p><p></p><p>THE CUSP OF THE AGES.</p><p>&#x201c;In Spirit I was caught away into the realms of Akasha; I stood alone within the circle of the sun.</p><p>&#x201c;And there I found the secret spring that opens up the door to Wisdom and an understanding heart.</p><p>&#x201c;I entered in and then I knew.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the four and twenty Cherubim and Seraphim that guard the circle of the sun, the mighty ones who were proclaimed by masters long ago &#x2018;the four and twenty ancient ones.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the names of every Cherubim and Seraphim, and learned that every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by two&#x2014;a Cherubim and Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;And then I stood upon the cusp where Ages meet. The Piscean Age had passed; the Aquarian Age had just begun.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the guardian Spirits of the Piscean Age; Ramasa is the Cherubim; Vacabiel is Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the guardian Spirits of the Aquarian Age, and Archer is the Cherubim; Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;These four great spirits of the Triune God stood close together on the cusp, and in the presence of the sacred Three&#x2014;the God of Might, the God of Wisdom, and the God of Love&#x2014;the scepter of Domain, of Might, of Wisdom and of Love was there transferred.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the charges of the Triune God; but these I may not now reveal.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the history of the Piscean Age from Piscean Cherubim and Seraphim, and when I took my pen to write Ramasa said: </p><p>&#x201c;Not now, my son, not now; but you may write it down for men when men have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood, of Peace on earth, good-will to every living thing.</p><p>&#x201c;And then I heard the Aquarian Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim the Gospel of the coming Age, the age of Wisdom, of the Son of Man.</p><p>&#x201c;And when the crown was lifted from the head of Ramasa and placed upon the head of Archer of the Aquarian Age; and when the royal scepter was transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to Seraphim Sakmaquil there was deep silence in the courts of heaven.</p><p>&#x201c;And then the goddess Wisdom spoke, and with her hands outstretched she poured the benedictions of the Holy Breath upon the rulers of Aquarius.</p><p>&#x201c;I may not write the words she spoke, but I may tell the Gospel of the coming age that Archer told when he received the crown.</p><p>&#x201c;And I may breathe to men the song of praise that Seraphim Sakmaquil sung when she received the royal scepter of the newborn age.</p><p>&#x201c;This Gospel I will tell, and I will sing this song in every land, to all the people, tribes and t...</p></p><h2>Finding George Orwell in Burma</h2><p>A profile of the police state in Burma and its effect on the writings of George Orwell discusses the author&#39;s mother&#39;s origins in Burma at the height of the British raj, Orwell&#39;s work with the British Imperial Police, and local reverence for his literary works. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>"A truer picture of authoritarianism than anyone has written since, perhaps, Orwell himself."<br> <i>&#x2014;Mother Jones</i> <br><br> "Mournful, meditative, appealingly idiosyncratic . . . an exercise in literary detection but also a political travelogue."<br> <i>&#x2014;The New York Times</i> <br><br> "Combining literary criticism with solid field reporting, [Larkin] captures the country at its best and, more often, its worst."<br> <i>&#x2014;San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br><br> "[A] sobering, journalistic memoir . . .

What makes some men and women perform extraordinary deeds on the battlefield? What makes them risk their lives in the pursuit of victory? And do their successes or failures in combat bring them happiness, melancholy, or fulfillment? <br><br>Max Hastings&#x2019;s &#x201c;authority [and] humanity&#x201d; in depicting &#x201c;the realities of combat&#x201d; (Alistair Horne, <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>) has been greatly praised on the release of his previous book, <i>Armageddon</i>, which documented the last eight months in the European theater of World War II. In <i>Warriors</i>, Hastings takes up the experience of fourteen soldiers and airmen, together with one remarkable sailor, who fought in the wars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, portraying their triumphs, follies, and, sometimes, tragedies. We meet Baron Marbot, an exuberant cavalry officer who joined Napoleon&#x2019;s army at the age of seventeen and fought through Waterloo in a happy and shameless pursuit of glory; paratrooper &#x201c;Slim Jim&#x201d; Gavin, an orphan who enlisted in World War II to escape his miserable boyhood and went on to become America&#x2019;s youngest general since Custer; Nancy Wake, a dashing Australian who fought for the resistance in Nazi-occupied France; Avigdor Kahalani, an Israeli officer hideously burned in the Six-Day War, who, six years later, was one of the tank commanders who saved his country during the defense of the Golan Heights in the Yom Kippur War.

Each writer&#x2019;s work reflects in full measure his national characteristics. None but a Frenchman, surely, could have written the following lines about his experience of conflict: &#x201c;I may, I think, say without boasting that nature has allotted to me a fair share of courage; I will add that there was a time when I enjoyed being in danger, as my thirteen wounds and some distinguished services prove, I think, sufficiently.&#x201d; Baron Marcellin de Marbot was the model for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s fictional Brigadier Gerard: brave, swashbuckling, incapable of introspection, glorying without inhibition in the experience of campaigning from Portugal to Russia in the service of his emperor. Marbot was the most eager of warriors, who shared with many of his French contemporaries a belief that there could be no higher calling than to follow Bonaparte to glory. Few modern readers could fail to respect the courage of a soldier who so often faced the fire of the enemy, through an active service career spanning more than forty years. And no Anglo-Saxon could withhold laughter at the peacock vanity and chauvinism of the hussar&#x2019;s account of the experience, rich in anecdotage and comedy, the latter often unintended.<br><br> Jean-Baptiste-Antoine-Marcellin de Marbot was born in 1782 at Beaulieu in the Corr�ze, son of a country gentleman of liberal inclinations who became a general in France&#x2019;s revolutionary army. With his round face and snub nose, the child Marcellin was known to his family as &#x201c;the kitten,&#x201d; and for some years during the nation&#x2019;s revolutionary disorders attended a local girls&#x2019; school. He was originally destined for a naval career, but a friend urged his father that life aboard a warship mouldering in some seaport under British blockade was no prospect for an ambitious youth. Instead, in 1799 a vacancy was procured for him in the hussars. The seventeen-year-old boy was delighted, and from the outset gloried in his new uniform. His father, however, was uneasy about his shyness, and for some time was prone to refer to his son in company as &#x201c;Mademoiselle Marcellin&#x201d;&#x2014;rich pickings there for a modern psychologist. In those days when every hussar was expected to display a moustache as part of his service dress, the beardless teenager at first painted whiskers on his face.<br><br> Marbot met Bonaparte for the first time when accompanying his father to take up a posting with the army in Italy. They were amazed to encounter the hero of the Pyramids at Lyons, on his way back to Paris from Egypt, having abandoned his army to seek a throne, a quest to which General Marbot, a committed republican, declined to give his assistance. In Italy, young Marcellin won his spurs. Despatched with a patrol to seize Austrian prisoners, the sergeant in command professed sudden illness. The boy seized the opportunity and assumed leadership of the troop: &#x201c;When . . . I took command of the fifty men who had come under my orders in such unusual circumstances, a mere trooper as I was and seventeen years old, I resolved to show my comrades that if I had not yet much experience or military talent, I at least possessed pluck. So I resolutely put myself at their head and marched on in what we knew was the direction of the enemy.&#x201d;<br><br> Marbot&#x2019;s patrol surprised an Austrian unit, took the necessary prisoners, and returned in triumph to the French lines where their self-appointed commander was rewarded with promotion to sergeant, followed soon afterwards by a commission. He survived the terrible siege of Genoa, where his father died in his arms following a wound received on the battlefield. Soon afterwards the young man was posted to the 25th Chasseurs. In 1801 he was appointed an aide-de-camp to that hoary old hero Marshal Augereau, with whom he travelled for the first time to the Iberian Peninsula.<br><br> By 1805, already a veteran, Marbot was an eager young officer with Bonaparte&#x2019;s Grand Army, ready for a summer of campaigning against the Austrians and Russians. &#x201c;I had three excellent horses,&#x201d; he enthused, adding bathetically, &#x201c;and a servant of moderate quality.&#x201d; The duties of aides-de-camp were among the most perilous in any army of the time. It was their business to convey their masters&#x2019; wishes and tidings not only across the battlefield, but from end to end of Europe, often in the teeth of the enemy. In the period that followed, writes Marbot, &#x201c;constantly sent from north to south, and from south to north, wherever there was fighting going on, I did not pass one of these ten years without coming under fire, or without shedding my blood on the soil of some part of Europe.&#x201d; It is striking to notice that, until the twentieth century, every enthusiastic warrior regarded it as a mark of virility to have been wounded in action, if possible frequently. A soldier who avoided shedding his own blood, far from being congratulated on luck and skill, was more likely to be suspected of shyness.<br><br> Marbot began the 1805 campaigning season by carrying despatches from the emperor to Marshal Mass�na in Italy, through the Alpine passes. Then he took his place beside Augereau for what became the Austerlitz campaign. &#x201c;Never had France possessed an army so well-trained,&#x201d; he exulted, &#x201c;of such good material, so eager for fighting and fame . . . Bonaparte . . . accepted the war with joy, so certain was he of victory . . . He knew how the chivalrous spirit of Frenchmen has in all ages been influenced by the enthusiasm of military glory.&#x201d; Seldom has there been an era of warfare in which officers and soldiers alike strove so ardently for distinction. If there were young blades in Bonaparte&#x2019;s army who confined themselves to doing their duty, history knows nothing of them. In the world of France&#x2019;s marshals and their subordinates, there was a relentless contest for each to outdo the others in braving peril with insouciance. Its spirit was supremely captured by the tale of Ney, after the battle of Lutzen, encountering the emperor. &#x201c;My dear cousin! But you are covered in blood!&#x201d; exclaimed Bonaparte in alarm. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t mine, Sire,&#x201d; responded the marshal complacently, &#x201c;except where that damned bullet passed through my leg!&#x201d;<br><br> Having survived the carnage at Austerlitz, Marbot found himself among a throng of French officers sitting their horses around Bonaparte on the day after the battle, gazing out on the broken ice of the Satschan Lake, strewn with debris and corpses. Amid it all, a hundred yards from the shore they beheld a Russian sergeant, shot through the thigh and clinging to an ice floe deeply stained with his blood. The wounded man, spying the glittering assembly, raised himself and cried out in Russian, &#x201c;All men become brothers once battle is done.&#x201d; He begged his life from the emperor of the French. The entreaty was translated. Bonaparte, in a characteristic impulse of imperial condescension, told his entourage to do whatever was necessary to save the Russian. A handful of men plunged into the icy water, seized floating baulks of timber, and sought to paddle themselves out to the floe. Within seconds they became clumsy prisoners of their frozen clothing. They abandoned efforts to save the enemy soldier, and struggled ashore to save themselves.<br><br> Marbot, a spectator, declared that their error had been to brave the water fully clad. Bonaparte nodded assent. The would-be rescuers had shown more zeal than discretion, observed the emperor dryly. The hussar now felt obliged to put his own counsel into practice. Leaping from his horse, he tore off his clothes and sprang into the lake. He acknowledged the shock of the deadly cold, but &#x201c;the emperor&#x2019;s presence encouraged me, and I struck out towards the Russian sergeant. At the same time my example, and probably the praise given me by the emperor, determined a lieutenant of artillery . . . to imitate me.&#x201d; As he struggled painfully amid the great daggers of ice, Marbot was dismayed to find his rival catching him up. Yet he was obliged to admit that alone, he could never have succeeded in his attempt. Together, and with immense labour, the two Frenchmen pushed the wounded Russian on his crumbling floe towards the shore, battering a path through the jumble of ice before them. At last they came close enough for onlookers to throw out lifelines. The two swimmers seized the ropes and passed them around the wounded man, enabling him to be dragged to safety. They themselves, at their last gasp, bleeding and torn, staggered ashore to receive their laurels. Bonaparte called his mameluke Roustan to bring them a glass of rum apiece. He gave gold to the wounded soldier, who proved to be Lithuanian. Once recovered, the man became a devoted follower of the emperor, a sergeant in his Polish lancers. Marbot&#x2019;s companion in mercy, the lieutenant of artillery, was so weakened by his experience that after months in hospital, Marbot recorded pityingly that he had to be invalided out of the service. The hussar, of course, was back on duty next day.<br><br> Marbot saw as much of Bonaparte as any man of his rank through the years that followed. In July 1806 he carried despatches to the French Embassy in Berlin, and returned to report to the emperor in Paris that he had seen Prussian officers defiantly sharpening sabres on the embassy steps. &#x201c;The insolent braggarts shall soon learn that our weapons need no sharpening!&#x201d; exclaimed Bonaparte. We may suspect that the emperor viewed Marbot just as his fictional self viewed Gerard in Conan Doyle&#x2019;s tales&#x2014;a wo...</p><h2>Sylvia Plath Drawings</h2><p>In 1956 Sylvia Plath wrote to her mother, Aurelia Plath: &#39;I feel I&#39;m developing a kind of primitive style of my own which I am very fond of.

Performing night after night - from his early teens to his tragic death at age thirty-five, in tiny pass-the-hat clubs and before thousands in huge arenas - Stevie Ray Vaughan fused blazing technique with deep soul in a manner unrivaled since the days of Jimi Hendrix. The genuineness and passion of his music moved millions. It nearly saved his life. Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire is the first biography of this meteoric guitar hero. Emerging from the hotbed of Texas blues, Stevie Ray Vaughan developed his unique style early on, in competition with his older brother, Jimmie Vaughan, founder of the Fabulous Thunderbirds - a competition that shaped much of Stevie&#39;s life. Fueled by drugs and alcohol through a thousand one-night stands, he lived at a fever pitch that nearly destroyed him. Musically exhausted and close to collapse, in his final years Stevie Ray mustered the courage to overcome his addictions, finding strength and inspiration in a new emotional openness. His death in a freak helicopter crash in 1990 silenced one of the great musical talents of our time. Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire reveals Stevie Ray Vaughan&#39;s life in all its remarkable, sometimes unsavory detail. It also brings to life the rich world of Texas music out of which he grew, and captures the staggering dimensions of his musical legacy. It will stand as the definitive biographical portrait of Stevie Ray.The brief life of the legendary Texas blues-guitarist, well told by Patoski (a senior editor at Texas Monthly) and writer/radio producer Crawford, both of whom live in Austin and saw dozens of Vaughan concerts. Raised around Dallas, Vaughan (1954-90) was a guitar prodigy whose greatest influence was his older brother Jimmie, also a guitarist. Whatever musical instrument Jimmie tried to play, Vaughan was sure to imitate him, and as his brother got better instruments, Stevie played Jimmie's electric hand-me-downs. At ten, Vaughan already was feeding on the legends of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Johnny Ace, and Bobby ``Blue'' Bland. Determined to make a living off his guitar, he quit school and took his group to Austin, which was then a mirror of the hippie paradise in San Francisco. Even so, Vaughan was neck-deep in low self-esteem and forever hid behind his guitar, but as his powers became more widely known, his intensity as a musician only deepened: During one gig, after playing his finger callus off down to the quick, he borrowed some Superglue, glued the callus back on, and went on with the show. Vaughan played blues with all the giants, from Eric Clapton to Jeff Beck, but eventually drugs and booze numbed the soul out of his playing. At 32, glazed and whacked out, he went to a Georgia rehab, then--with a hand from fellow recoverer Clapton--made a fabulous comeback, remaining sober to his last breath. Just before his death in a helicopter crash, following a concert with Clapton and some fellow legends, he made a record with brother Jimmie, their first together. Released less than three weeks after Vaughan's death, Family Style instantly zapped the charts. Patoski and Crawford do an exceptionally strong job on Vaughan's final three years sober, his early fears, and his huge comeback.

I'm glad you've decided to try the South Beach Diet and have taken the first step toward a future filled with health and vitality. <br><br>The South Beach Diet can't be classified as a low-carb diet, a low-fat diet, or a high-protein diet. Its rules: Consume the right carbs and the right fats and learn to snack strategically. The South Beach Diet has been so widely successful because people lose weight without experiencing cravings or feeling deprived, or even feeling that they're on a diet. It allows you to enjoy "healthy" carbohydrates, rather than the kinds that contribute to weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. You can eat a great variety of foods in a great variety of recipes. This prevents repetition and boredom, two obstacles to long-term success. Our goal is that the South Beach Diet becomes a healthy lifestyle, not just a diet. The purpose of this guide is to help you to accomplish this with ease. Read on for more on the principles of the diet, how to use this Guide, and shopping and dining-out tips. <br><br>Good Fats, Bad Fats <br><br>Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. There's more and more evidence that many fats are good for us and actually reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. They also help our sugar and insulin metabolism and therefore contribute to our goals of long-term weight loss and weight maintenance. And because good fats make foods taste better, they help us enjoy the journey to a healthier lifestyle. But not all fats are created equal--there are good fats and bad fats. <br><br>"Good" fats include monounsaturated fats, found in olive and canola oils, peanuts and other nuts, peanut butter, and avocados. Monounsaturated fats lower total and "bad" LDL cholesterol--which accumulates in and clogs artery walls--while maintaining levels of "good" HDL cholesterol, which carries cholesterol from artery walls and delivers it to the liver for disposal. <br><br>Omega-3 fatty acids--polyunsaturated fats found in coldwater fish, canola oil, flaxseeds, walnuts, almonds, and macadamia nuts--also count as good fat. Recent studies have shown that populations that eat more omega-3s, like Eskimos (whose diets are heavy on fish), have fewer serious health problems like heart disease and diabetes. There is evidence that omega-3 oils helps prevent or treat depression, arthritis, asthma, and colitis and help prevent cardiovascular deaths. You'll eat both monounsaturated fats and omega-3s in abundance in all three phases of the Diet. <br><br>"Bad fats" include saturated fats--the heart-clogging kind found in butter, fatty red meats, and full-fat dairy products. <br><br>"Very bad fats" are the manmade trans fats. Trans fats, which are created when hydrogen gas reacts with oil, are found in many packaged foods, including margarine, cookies, cakes, cake icings, doughnuts, and potato chips. Trans fats are worse than saturated fats; they are bad for our blood vessels, nervous systems, and waistlines. <br><br>As this Guide went to press, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled that by 2006, food manufacturers must list the amount of trans fats in their products on the label. (The natural trans fats in meat and milk, which act very differently in the body than the manmade kind, will not require labeling.) Until then, here are a few ways to reduce your intake of trans fats and saturated fats, South Beach style. <br><br>Go natural: Limit margarine, packaged foods, and fast food, which tend to contain high amounts of saturated and trans fats. Make over your cooking methods: Bake, broil, or grill rather than fry. Lose the skin: Remove the skin from chicken or turkey before you eat it. Ditch the butter: Cook with canola or olive oil instead of butter, margarine, or lard. Slim down your dairy: Switch from whole milk to fat-free or 1% milk. <br><br>Good Carbs, Bad Carbs <br><br>Carbohydrates, foods that contain simple sugars (short chains of sugar molecules) or starches (long chains of sugar molecules), have been blamed for our epidemic of obesity and diabetes. This is only partially true, because there are both good and bad carbohydrates. The good carbs contain the important vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that are essential to our health and that help prevent heart disease and cancer. The bad carbs, which have been consumed by Americans in unprecedented quantities (largely in an attempt to avoids fats), are the ones that have resulted in the fattening of America. Bad carbs are refined carbs, the ones where digestion has begun in factories instead of in our stomachs. The good carbs are the ones humans were designed to consume--the unrefined ones that have contributed to our health since we began eating! Unrefined carbohydrates are found in whole, natural foods, such as whole grains, legumes, rice, and starchy vegetables. They're also called complex carbohydrates, so named for their molecular structure. Besides being packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, good carbs take longer to digest--a good thing, as you'll soon see. <br>Refined carbohydrates, on the other hand, are found in packaged, processed foods, such as store-bought baked goods, crackers, pasta, and white bread. <br><br>Refined carbohydrates are made with white flour and contain little or no fiber. In fact, many products made with white flour are advertised as fortified with vitamins and minerals, because the process of turning grain into white flour strips away its fiber and nutrients. One of our South Beach Diet rules is to avoid foods labeled as "fortified." Current evidence is that fortification with vitamins does not recreate the benefits of the natural vitamins that have been removed. <br><br>Despite the fact that good carbs are a critical part of a healthy diet, the typical American diet is filled with the bad kinds. And when we're overweight as a result of a diet laden with bad carbs, our bodies' ability to process all carbohydrates goes awry.

Culled from traditional sources--the Bible, Talmud, Midrash, hasidic texts, and oral folklore--and retold in modern English by Ellen Frankel, these stories represent the brightest jewels in the vast treasure chest of Jewish lore.Beautifully clothed in contemporary language, these classic tales sparkle with the gentle and insightful humor of the Jewish folk imagination. And like so much of Jewish literature, these stories abound in allusions to classic Jewish texts. Biblical cadences, phrases from the prayer book, and ideas from Jewish proverbs and heroic legends resonate in the air when these tales are read or told aloud. In The Classic Tales, history sheds its dust to become as intimate as family memory. While the breadth and depth of this book make it completely unique, three special features also help distinguish it: God appears without gender (though certainly not without personality); women characters, so often nameless in the original biblical text, wear their midrashic names (e.g., Noah&#39;s wife Naamah, Abraham&#39;s mother Amitlai, Lot&#39;s wife Edith); and many tales of Sephardic origin have been included to correct the common American bias toward Eastern European sources. What&#39;s more, this volume has been uniquely designed to be of use to educators, rabbis, parents, and students. It features a chronological table of contents as well as six separate indexes? arranged by Jewish holidays, Torah and Haftorah readings, character types, symbols, topics, and proper names and places--to make the tales easily referenced in a wide variety of ways. Anyone who needs a story to inspire a child, to illustrate a point, to develop a sermon, or just to uplift his or her own thirsting soul will find just the right one in The Classic Tales.</p><p>Frankel has compiled the classic stories and tales of 4,000 years of Jewish legend, and made them accessible without necessitating hours of Talmudic study. There&#39;s Lot&#39;s Wife, The Witches of Ashkelon, and 298 more, culled from the Bible, the Talmud, and Diaspora lore. The writing is simple enough to read aloud to children, the font&#39;s large enough to invite the tired eye, and the selection&#39;s interesting enough to read to yourself after bedtime stories are over. Well-referenced so you can look up the Giant Og when you want, it&#39;s the sort of book that becomes a family favorite.<b> Dr. Ellen Frankel served for eighteen years as the Editor in Chief and CEO of The Jewish Publication Society, and currently serves as its first Editor Emerita.&nbsp; She received her B.A. from the University of Michigan and her Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Princeton.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> She is the author of ten books, among them <i>The Classic Tales</i>; <i>The Encyclopedia of Jewish Symbols</i>; <i>The Five Books of Miriam</i>, also available in Hebrew as <i>Midrash Miryam</i>; <i>The Jewish Spirit: A Celebration in Stories and Art</i>, and <i>The Illustrated Hebrew Bible</i>.

But today the situation has grown even more dire. From the murders of black youth by the police, to the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act, to the disaster visited upon poor and middle-class black families by the Great Recession, it is clear that black America faces an emergency&#x2014;at the very moment the election of the first black president has prompted many to believe we&#x2019;ve solved America&#x2019;s race problem.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Democracy in Black</i> is Eddie S. Glaude Jr.'s impassioned response. Part manifesto, part history, part memoir, it argues that we live in a country founded on a &#x201c;value gap&#x201d;&#x2014;with white lives valued more than others&#x2014;that still distorts our politics today. Whether discussing why all Americans have racial habits that reinforce inequality, why black politics based on the civil-rights era have reached a dead end, or why only remaking democracy from the ground up can bring real change, Glaude crystallizes the untenable position of black America--and offers thoughts on a better way forward. Forceful in ideas and unsettling in its candor, <i>Democracy In Black </i>is a landmark book on race in America, one that promises to spark wide discussion as we move toward the end of our first black presidency.</p><p><b>EDDIE S.

She had been through hell and back and the wounds had not healed. Chris had worked hard all her life. She and her late husband had dreamed big dreams for themselves and their family. They had played by the rules. But when Chris lost her home to foreclosure in 2012 everything changed. Now, at the age of sixty-five, she was out of work and forced to live in a senior facility, her cherished home gone, her health deteriorating, and her dreams shattered.</p><p>&#x201c;Me and my husband had a business for twenty-five years,&#x201d; she said in disbelief. &#x201c;I raised my daughter in that home. I wasn&#x2019;t a new homeowner. I had been there for eighteen years.&#x201d;</p><p>Before the eviction, Chris had lived with her eighty-five-year-old mother, her adult daughter, and her four-year-old grandson in a triplex home in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. The upstairs had three bedrooms, two baths, and two big living rooms. There were two separate apartments downstairs. The house sat on a large plot of land, with lots of open space where Chris&#x2019;s dog, Sheeba, could run around. A minister who was a little person had designed the house. &#x201c;He had been an architect, I guess. And there was not a square room in that house, the way he designed it. That&#x2019;s why I fell in love with it.&#x201d; Within a year of moving into their home, her husband lost his legs because of diabetes and had to use a wheelchair. &#x201c;But here&#x2019;s the kicker,&#x201d; Chris said. &#x201c;Since the house had been built for a dwarf, once the ramp was built, he could maneuver in that house just like anybody else because the switches were lower. It was like God sent us there.&#x201d;</p><p>But when Chris lost her job in 2009 she struggled to keep making the payments. The house was underwater. She had already paid $240,000 on a home now valued at $40,000. Her mortgage changed hands at least three times in six months. Chris tried everything to prevent foreclosure, but the latest holder of her loan--Investors One Corporation--decided to evict her. President Obama had created a plan to help distressed borrowers, but Chris couldn&#x2019;t take advantage of it; the program required that homeowners be current on their mortgage, and she was not. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;re current on your mortgage, you don&#x2019;t need modification,&#x201d; Chris said. The game seemed rigged to protect the mortgage lenders.</p><p>Dekalb County sheriffs and deputies arrived in the middle of the night on May 2, 2012, to evict her. &#x201c;They came in like I was a dope dealer. At three in the morning they drilled a hole in the lock in my front door. They drilled out the lock and just came in my house. It was the most terrifying moment that I can remember in my life. My grandson is six years old, and to this day he does not like police officers, because he remembers. He remembers.&#x201d;</p><p>When the police stormed into the house they ordered Chris and her family to get dressed immediately. Then they proceeded to empty the home of a life&#x2019;s worth of memories. It was chaos. For seven hours the police piled Chris&#x2019;s things onto the street. No one could help. The police had cordoned off the area. &#x201c;They told me to pack up as if I just had a fire at my home and take my immediate possessions. And I had to leave immediately,&#x201d; she remembered. Everything was scattered, without any care, across the lawn. With no place to go, the family slept in the car--except for the family dog. The police made provisions for Sheeba.</p><p>&#x201c;That was the part that I think came out in the eviction. When they came for me at three in the morning, they didn&#x2019;t have a place for me and my family to go, but the animal shelter came because they knew that there were dogs there. They came with a place for my dog.&#x201d;</p><p>The sprawling metropolis of Atlanta sat at the epicenter of the housing crisis that shook the foundations of the American economy. Once considered a promised land where good-paying jobs and affordable living offered a real chance for people to fulfill their dreams, by 2012, Atlanta was a wasteland of foreclosed homes and skyrocketing unemployment. In 2007 black unemployment in greater Atlanta was 8.3 percent, but by 2010, that figure had nearly doubled. Chris was among the casualties. According to the Federal Reserve, Atlanta held the dubious distinction of having &#x201c;the most government-owned foreclosed properties for sale of any large city.&#x201d; The hard reality was undeniable, and Chris was just one example among many: the housing crisis was devastating black Atlanta, and it hardly stopped there. Like an out-of-control wildfire spreading across dry brushland, the crisis engulfed black America.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be like this.</p><p>The road to the housing crisis in black America was paved with good intentions, sort of. In June of 2002 President George W. Bush made his way to the pulpit of a quaint African Methodist Episcopal church in Atlanta. &#x201c;Now, we&#x2019;ve got a problem here in America that we have to address,&#x201d; he told the crowd.</p><p>Too many American families, too many minorities do not own a home. There is a home ownership gap in America. The difference between Anglo American and African American and Hispanic home ownership is too big. And we&#x2019;ve got to focus the attention of this nation to address this.</p><p>Bush had come to St. Paul AME to announce his plans for an &#x201c;ownership society.&#x201d; By 2010, he wanted to increase homeownership among minorities by at least 5.5 million. This required making it easier for low-income buyers to make a down payment; it meant that more affordable housing needed to be available in certain neighborhoods and involved streamlining the home-buying process.</p><p>Bush hoped to achieve his goal through a vast network of public-private partnerships. He announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would &#x201c;increase their commitment to minority markets by more than $440 billion.&#x201d; Freddie Mac would make it possible for &#x201c;consumers with poor credit . . . to get a mortgage with an interest rate that automatically goes down after a period of consistent payments&#x201d;; Fannie Mae would partner with 100 faith-based organizations to improve homeownership education, and organizations like the Enterprise Foundation would help rebuild and rehabilitate urban neighborhoods in partnership with local community groups.</p><p>The congregation lavished the president with applause. It was a surreal moment. Here was the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world--a Republican--stating unequivocally that he was committed to the idea that people of color should own something.</p><p>Before delivering the speech, President Bush toured Park Place South, a new development of affordable housing in an area once marked by crime and urban blight. There, he met Darrin West, a black Atlanta police officer who proudly showed off his new home. The president held up West as an example of what was possible with the policies he was promoting. And Bush&#x2019;s initial efforts to increase homeownership among African Americans were indeed quite successful. The rate of black homeownership rose to 49.1 percent during the height of the housing boom.</p><p>But the initiatives President Bush outlined in Atlanta unleashed torrid forces seeking to exploit &#x201c;emerging markets.&#x201d; According to the Center for Responsible Lending, African Americans were 150 percent more likely to get a high-cost loan with low interest rates that adjusted upward after two or three years. From 2007 to 2009, the African American homeownership rate fell by 6 percent (to the lowest level since 1995), a drop more than twice that experienced by any other racial group in the United States. African Americans lost more than 240,000 homes</p><p>One of them was Darrin West. He couldn&#x2019;t sell his home, so he gave it back to the bank and simply walked away. <i>The New York Times</i> reported that by 2008, &#x201c;at least 10 percent of [the] 232 homes&#x201d; in West&#x2019;s Park Place South development had been hit with foreclosure. This pattern played itself out across black America, as billions of dollars disappeared from communities already strapped for resources.</p><p>The irony is obvious and biting. So many Americans reveled in the historic significance of Barack Obama&#x2019;s election in 2008. There was a sense of real, exciting possibility, even as the nation confronted the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It was a moment of contrasts, of decline but also of possibility--that somehow we were putting the ugliness of our racial past behind us as the country teetered on economic collapse. Uncertainty shadowed national euphoria, and this was especially true for African Americans. Many danced election night away and talked about the fulfillment of the civil rights movement, then woke up to foreclosure notices on their doors.</p><p>The foreclosure crisis among African Americans gives a clear sense of the despair and devastation wrought by what can only be called the Great Black Depression. The 2008 recession threatened the economic foundations of the country; over and over again we heard from economists and pundits that the nation had not experienced anything like this since the Great Depression. Venerable financial institutions collapsed. Liquidity froze. Jobs disappeared overnight. The recession cast a dark economic shadow over America.</p><p>But in black America, the reality was even bleaker. I mean this beyond the familiar platitude that says &#x201c;whenever white America has a cold, black America has the flu.&#x201d; The reality is that by every relevant statistical measure (employment, wages, wealth, etc.) black America has experienced and is experiencing a depression. This is more like the symptoms of a national congenital disease than the flu.</p><p>To be sure, the circumstances of black America have waxed and waned since the heyday of the civil rights movement. The black freedom struggle of the 1960s brought unprecedented improvement in the lives of most African Americans. But even with these gains, the gap between whites and blacks persisted through the 1970s and 1980s alongside brewing racial tensions (often because of police violence) and deepening class divisions within black America. Combined with cyclical economic booms and busts, the slow march from the end of Jim Crow to full equality felt more like a bad roller-coaster ride. It was not until the long recovery of the 1990s, spurred by governmental policy and strong economic growth, that we began to see significant economic improvements for black America&#x2014;particularly for the black middle class.</p><p>Fast-forward to the Great Black Depression of 2008. Much of the gains of the 1990s were erased. African Americans lost 31 percent of their wealth between 2007 and 2010. White Americans lost 11 percent. By 2009, 35 percent of African American households had zero or negative net worth. According to the Pew Research Center, by 2011, black families had lost 53 percent of their wealth. Just think about it: an entire decade of economic gains wiped away. Gone. This wasn&#x2019;t just the loss of homes--the primary source of wealth for most African Americans--but lost retirement savings, which shrank by 35 percent from 2007 to 2010. As many struggled to save their homes, as they witnessed the stock market spiral downward and their pensions dwindle to nothing, they took out what little money they had invested in order to keep themselves afloat. Many could not wait for the market to rebound to reap its benefits. Their children won&#x2019;t be able to either.</p><p>As they lost their homes and saw their savings wiped out, people also lost their jobs, making it hard to imagine ever clawing their way back to where they&#x2019;d once been. Often the last hired and first fired, people saw black unemployment soar as a result of the economic collapse. So much so that by November 2010, national black unemployment reached the stunning level of 16 percent (and this figure does not include those who simply dropped out of the labor market). White unemployment stood at 9 percent. Some cities, including Detroit and New York, reported unemployment among black males at close to 50 percent.</p><p>For all these reasons, poverty is growing in black America. One out of four African Americans lives in poverty today. One out of three black children grows up in poverty, while only one out of ten white children lives in poverty. One out of five black children is growing up in extreme poverty. That child&#x2019;s parents make less than $11,746 a year for a family of four. They live on $979 a month, $226 a week, or what ends up being $32 a day. In twenty-five of the fifty states and in the District of Columbia, at least 40 percent of African American children are poor. This is galling for a nation that considers itself the leader of the free world and a pioneer of democratic principles.</p><p>Given the impact on African American children, this crisis is not only an event of the present. Its implications for future generations of African Americans have yet to be calculated. Chris Frazer&#x2019;s six-year-old grandson will remember the horror of police tossing his family&#x2019;s possessions out in the yard like garbage as they were evicted, but beyond those memories, what will he inherit? Like so many young African Americans in this country, he will have to start economically with little or no help from the previous generation, because social and systemic barriers have severely limited economic mobility for black folk; the Great Black Depression took the one thing his grandmother could claim as her own. His financial inheritance will be a balance of broken promises.</p><p>Such crushing poverty dashes the dreams of millions of children daily. But not only that: it almost ensures that they will lead less healthy lives as they grow up; that they will more than likely drop out of high school; that they will experience some form of violence in their lifetime; that they will likely find themselves caught up in the criminal justice system; and that they will end up raising their children in the same horrifying conditions they grew up in. In short, the terrible effects of the Great Black Depression guarantee, unless we fully understand the urgency of now, that even darker days are ahead.</p><p>The very foundations of black America have cracked under the weight of the economic fallout. It has affected what we own, how we work, and the future of our children. But what&#x2019;s really scary is how little anyone outside black America seems to care.</p><p>Patricia Hill was defiant. A judge had given her 75 days to vacate her beautiful home in the historic Bronzeville section of Chicago. In 2003 she&#x2019;d obtained a lower fixed-rate mortgage with the intent of using the savings for extensive home repairs. Five years later Patricia noticed that her mortgage payment had increased by $500. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t nobody afford $500 extra a month,&#x201d; she complained. Saxon Mortgage Services said it would correct the mistake. She continued to pay her regular mortgage, only to be told later that her account was in arrears. Patricia was caught in the spider&#x2019;s web of predatory lending.</p></p><h2>The War: A Memoir</h2><p>The author, once part of the French Resistance movement, tells of her experiences during the Nazi occupation of Paris and the emotional return of her husband, on the brink of death from being in a concentration camp</p><p>Marguerite Duras, one of France&#39;s most important writers, was a member of the French Resistance movement throughout the Second World War.

A native of north Texas, she currently lives in Germany with her family.<br>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Seylin hurried through the maze of hallways in the great underground goblin palace and knocked on Emily's door. They had been close friends since childhood, but Seylin wasn't a child anymore. He was one of the King's Guard now, and his black uniform matched his black hair and eyes. The girl he had played with had grown into a young woman. By human standards, Emily looked quite average, and the elvish Seylin looked quite remarkable, but Seylin was the one who found himself daydreaming about Emily's brown eyes and warm smile. He couldn't even tell if she cared.<br><br>There was a scramble, and Emily's door popped open to reveal his friend Brindle's little daughter, her snake eyes gleaming up at him. In her arms she clutched Talah, Emily's monkey, rolled up in a blanket like a doll.<br><br>"Where's Em?" he asked, and the little girl pointed wordlessly behind her. He found Emily seated on the terrace, teaching a very small goblin boy to fasten a buckle. Emily was always surrounded by children. They appealed to her high spirits and love of excitement. Goblin babies were more fun than human babies, she said, because human babies never bit large chunks out of the furniture or tried to take off on awkward wings and crashed into the wall.<br><br>The handsome Seylin was an embarrassing anomaly in an ugly goblin world. His parents had almost died of shame over their son's striking features. Having grown up with teasing, inaudible whispers, and sympathetic glances, the sensitive young man had always enjoyed the company of Emily's many visiting children because he never felt that they were mocking him or gossiping over his looks. But lately, he had found all the bustle and confusion a little hard to take.<br><br>"Can't I ever see you alone?" he asked crossly, sitting down beside her.<br><br>"Goodness, I am alone," responded the young woman. "Just Brindle's two before class this morning. This afternoon I'm expecting a dozen. We're going to the kitchens to bake cakes."<br><br>Seylin sighed. She was right. This was as alone as she ever was.<br><br>"Em, I've been thinking," he began. "We're older now, and I wanted to talk to you. After all, we're not little pages anymore." He paused. "We need to talk."<br><br>"I've been wanting to talk to you, too," declared Emily with some force. "Ever since you came back from that trading journey last spring, all you do is stand around and goggle at me. You hardly say five words, and if I look like I'm having any fun, you glower at me just like an old governess."<br><br>Seylin was glowering now. He tried to make himself stop. "That's not what I want to talk about," he protested. "What I wanted to say is that I won't always be a guard-"<br><br>"Nothing wrong with the Guard," remarked Emily breezily. "Thaydar told me last night he thinks the Guard's never looked better. Sweetie, we'd better run you to the bathroom," she added, standing up with the tiny goblin.<br><br>"So Thaydar was here again!" snapped Seylin.<br><br>"Not now," called Emily, hurrying off and leaving him free to glower unobserved. Thaydar, the cat-eyed commander of the Guard, was his most serious rival for Emily's affection. Thaydar made no secret of the fact that he wanted the prestige of a non-goblin bride, and he was one of the most important men in the kingdom. To make matters worse, he was Seylin's commanding officer. Seylin had spent many evenings on patrol duty knowing that Thaydar was keeping Emily company back home.<br><br>After a few minutes of gloomy contemplation, Seylin wandered back into the apartment to find Emily breaking up a fight between the two children. Each of them had one of Talah's arms and refused to let go.<br><br>"No monkey for either of you," said Emily, prying them loose. Talah bounced into Seylin's arms, and he sat down on the couch with her.<br><br>"Em, I don't want to be a guard all my life," he continued earnestly. "There's nothing to guard. It's so boring. I don't want to be a lore-master, either, teaching the Unlock Spell over and over to crowds of pages, and I don't want to be a scholar. They just study things. I want to live stories, not read them."<br><br>Emily was pouring drinks and barely paying attention. She had heard all of this before. The little boy promptly dumped his cup down his front. She carried him over to the couch and sat down, scrubbing him off with a towel.<br><br>rd"Did I tell you that Jacoby was here last night," she said, "and he choked on a piece of caramel? I had to whack him on the back for a long time before it went down. I've learned something, Seylin. Goblins with beaks shouldn't eat chewy candy. They don't have any way to chew it."<br><br>"Why do I ever try to talk to you?" cried Seylin. "You never listen to a word I say!"<br><br>"I'm listening," she protested. "You don't want to be anything."<br><br>"Right," he confirmed, trying to ignore the fact that the little girl was staring at him fixedly with her hypnotic snake eyes. "Right, I won't always be a guard, I promise. I'll be something more. I know I don't have much to offer you right now," he continued as the little girl dragged Talah from his arms. "But I think I will later."<br><br>"Thanks, I don't need anything," answered Emily absently. "Did you see Jacoby's new sister? Isn't she adorable with those little pink bird feet?" Seylin gritted his teeth, glaring at his heedless beloved. Here he was, sitting right next to her, and she might as well be a thousand miles away.<br><br>"Kitty, kitty," giggled Brindle's daughter, patting his knee.<br><br>"Very good! Kitty," said Emily encouragingly. "Seylin, change into a cat for her."<br><br>"Em, I am trying to have an important conversation!" shouted Seylin. "I will not change into a cat!"<br><br>Brindle's daughter drew back and buried her face in Emily's lap.<br><br>"And I suppose it's more important than making a little child happy," said Emily angrily, stroking the girl's hair as she cried.<br><br>"Yes! Yes, as a matter of fact, it is," declared Seylin, breathing hard.<br><br>"Well, go have it somewhere else then," ordered the righteous young woman. "I don't want to hear it."<br><br>"No, you don't, do you?" exclaimed Seylin, beside himself. "But you want to hear Thaydar, don't you? You drink in every word he says!"<br><br>This wasn't true. Thaydar spent as much time holding babies and repeating himself as Seylin did. He was just more philosophical about it.<br><br>"Thaydar isn't rude," Emily replied tartly.<br>0<br>"Rude? I'm rude? You never even listen to me, but that's not rude."<br><br>"I heard every word!" cried Emily. "You want to talk, you won't be a guard, you don't want to be anything, and I don't care. All you ever do is complain. Thaydar never does."<br><br>"Well, why don't you just marry Thaydar, since you're so fond of him?" he demanded.<br><br>"I certainly wouldn't marry you," declared the wrathful Emily. "Not if you were the last goblin on earth."<br><br>Seylin stared at her, his anger evaporating.<br><br>"Do you mean that?" he asked incredulously.<br><br>Emily was still furious. "Of course I do," she snapped, rising and catching the little boy as he made a dash for the terrace. Seylin stood up and stared after her for a minute, but she didn't turn around to look at him.<br><br>"Fine," he said bitterly. "Marry Thaydar, then." And he stormed out of the apartment.<br><br>***<br><br>Seylin found the goblin King in his workroom, giving his wife her magic lesson. The young man stopped in the doorway to watch, bending down to give Kate's drowsy dog a pat and exchanging a quiet greeting with the guard on duty in the hall.<br><br>The goblin King's Wife had required years of convincing before she had agreed to learn magic. She always felt uneasy about what her father would have said about it. Kate had been raised a perfect English gentlewoman. She had been shocked to learn that her great-great grandmother was an elf. Even though she was technically an elf-human cross, she was so strongly elvish that the goblins called her an elf, too.<br><br>Kate no longer noticed that her husband looked alarming. Nevertheless, the first sight of Marak had been enough to startle her into hysterics. The goblin King's body was powerful and bowlegged, with long, wiry arms and big, knotted hands. His magic hand had six fingers. His face was broad and bony, with sunken temples and deep eye sockets, and the eyes that gleamed brightly from under his bushy eyebrows were two different colors, one green and one black. Marak's skin was gray, and his lips and fingernails were a rather gruesome shade of tan. His hair was as coarse and straight as a horse's tail.<br><br>Kate still noticed her husband's hair. It fell in an unruly shock to his shoulders and into his eyes, and he had the habit of running his hands through it as he thought. Most of it was light beige, but a black patch grew back in a cowlick above his green eye, sending strands of black hair falling over the pale hair in what looked like long stripes. Kate disapproved of anything so untidy and kept their young son's hair short as a precaution against his developing his father's taste in hairstyles.<br><br>For this lesson, Kate was learning how to heat an elvish cooking stone. The nocturnal elves saw perfectly well in the dark but were blind in the dazzling day. Their eyes were even more sensitive than those of the goblins, so they cooked on special stones that gave off no light. The dwarves had made such a stone for Marak, flat and about a foot square. It lay now on the floor at Kate's feet, and a small metal pan full of water sat on it, waiting to be heated.<br><br>"You remember what I taught you about heat spells," Marak said, catching sight of Seylin and motioning for him not to disturb Kate. "They're based in Nameshda, the Warrior constellation, and they focus on the Foot Star. Find the constellation first and point to it." Kate, eyes closed, pointed toward the floor by the writing desk. "Reach to the Foot Star with one hand and with the other toward the stone as you say the spell. You should be able to feel the heat move by you on its way into the stone. Don't try to do too much. Less is better than more."<br><br>Kate nodded and moved her other hand into position. Marak watched as her lips moved and then looked down to examine the pan of water.<br><br>Seylin saw several things happen almost at once. Marak stepped back, throwing out his hand and giving a shout. All the water in the pan rushed up in a cloud of steam and whirled toward the King. When it reached his outstretched hand, the cloud splashed against an invisible wall and became a sheet of ice that fell to the floor and shattered. The metal pan melted with a sigh onto the stone, which was turning an alarming shade of cherry red.<br><br>Marak shouted again, but Kate stood oblivious, hands still outstretched. With a zing, the painted golden snake around her neck awoke and looped itself about her arms, jerking them to her sides. Marak bent and touched the stone, instantly chilling it. It cracked into several pieces, and the melted pan solidified into a flattened disk with the handle still extending from its side.<br><br>"What happened?" asked Kate curiously, opening her eyes.<br><br>i0Marak didn't look up. He was studying the wreckage of the cooking stone and pan, running his hand through his impossible hair. The golden snake twined back up to her shoulders and surveyed the damage too.<br><br>"Forty-seven King's Wives have tried to kill the King," it whispered calmly, "but only eight have tried to kill the King with elf magic." Seylin noticed a hint of complacent pride in the snake's sibilant voice.<br><br>"Charm, you know perfectly well I didn't try to kill the King!" said Kate in dismay. The snake looped around to study her innocent blue eyes. Then it let out a gentle hiss and collapsed back into painted sleep.<br><br>"Oh, yes you did, you bloodthirsty elf," replied Marak. "It's the Nameshda spells. Every time you've attempted a spell centered on the Warrior constellation, you've done some kind of damage. We don't need to wonder what your family did for the elf King, Kate. They were high-ranking military lords who devoted their lives to butchering goblins. When you make contact with the Warrior constellation, your proud elf blood burns, and you want to wrap your hands around the nearest goblin throat you can find."<br><br>"That's completely ridiculous!" exclaimed Kate. "Isn't it?" she added uncertainly.<br><br>For answer, Marak pried the pan off the shattered stone and held it out to her.<br><br>"Do I lie?" he pointed out. "No more Nameshda spells for you. Seylin, you can see why the King has to teach magic to outsiders. They can be very unpredictable and dangerous."<br><br>He put the pan on his writing desk and studied his petite, golden-haired wife for a minute. She certainly didn't look dangerous.<br><br>"No defense spells of any kind, Kate, they'll only strengthen your warrior tendencies. It's risky when the magic begins teaching itself like that. No more lessons this week, and we'd better calm down your right hand for a few days to prevent accidents. Your magic is excited now, and it will want more blood."<br><br>He took Kate's hand in both of his, the two right hands palm to palm, and stood motionless for a minute, frowning in concentration. After a few seconds, Kate tried to pull away.<br><br>"Ow!" she said. "Ow! Marak, you're hurting me!"<br><br>The goblin ignored her as he finished the magic. Then he looked down at her distressed face with a smile.<br><br>"That was your fault," he said. "You didn't want to give that power up, you elf assassin. You fought me to keep it. What killers your people must have been," he added, surveying her with fond pride. "It's lovely goblin revenge against your ancestors that I have you down here with me."<br><br>Kate felt her hand, scowling. "My whole arm's gone numb," she complained.<br><br>"And a very good thing, too," remarked the King, rubbing it for her. "I can't have you attacking our son the next time he comes running up to you. He's a little young to understand why his mother would try to kill him, and I think his defense magic would catch you by surprise."<br><br>"Marak!" exclaimed Kate. "I'd better not learn magic at all then. I don't want to hurt anybody."<br><br>"Other than me, you mean?" laughed her husband. "Don't fret. We'll just have to find something else you're good at besides killing people. Seylin, did you need to see me?"<br><br>Kate kissed her husband good-bye and walked off down the hallway, still rubbing her arm. The dog stood up, stretching luxuriously from her front feet to her back feet, and trotted off after her mistress.<br><br>Marak sat down at his desk and waved the young man to a stool. Seylin had always been Marak's special prot�g�, sharing the King's fascination with unusual magic, but he required a particular sort of handling. He wasn't like a goblin in his nature. He was sensitive and easily upset by things, the effect of his strongly dominant elf blood. Marak could see that he was upset now.<br><br>"Goblin King, I'm here to ask permission to leave the kingdom," divulged the miserable Seylin.<br><br>Marak's astonishment didn't show on his face. "When will you be coming back?" he asked.<br><br>"I don't know." Seylin sighed. "I don't think I will be coming back. I don't think there's much of a place for me here. I'm so different. I want to go live with my own people."<br><br>"Your own people," mused Marak, his unmatched eyes shrewd and the ghost of a smirk on his face. "Which people are those?"<br><br>The unhappy young man dropped his eyes guiltily and studied his hands without answering.<br><br>i0"Seylin," said Marak, "tell me what's wrong because it's something serious. At least, it had better be."<br><br>"I proposed to Em, and she rejected me," muttered Seylin. "She said she wants to marry Thaydar."<br><br>Marak stared at and through him, concen...</p><h2>Of Landscape and Longing: Finding a Home at the Water&#39;s Edge (The World As Home)</h2><p>Though Americans move frequently and often live far from the place they were born, they retain a memory of the landscape of childhood. For Carolyn Servid, and for others who love shorelines and boats, this imprinted place is where water meets trees. Using memoir as a means of meditation, Servid writes about connections to the land and the ways our love of a place can lead us to see it as an adversary, as she once felt during an ascent in Glacier Bay; as something to be consumed, as in the sprouting of mansions in the valleys of Colorado; or as a lover, as in her intimate, abiding knowledge of the shore near her home, where her greatest pleasure is to row her Banks dory among the whales and nearby islands.</p><p>Carolyn Servid, the child of American parents, grew up in a village in tropical India. America seemed to her, she writes in <i>Of Landscape and Longing</i>, "a world apart," a foreign country in which she could never quite fit. Small wonder, then, that she chose to settle in a once-remote and distant pocket of America, in the little Alaskan town of Sitka, to work as a writer and teacher. Her slender book gathers essays inspired by her time in India, Alaska, and places in between, essays that return to questions of how one finds and makes a home, a place of rootedness and belonging, a place in which to battle homesickness for all the other places we've known. A keen, spiritually inclined observer of the natural world, and a committed defender of the untamed forests that surround her, she writes easily of salmon and eagles, of clouds and spruce trees. And while Servid sometimes lapses into sentimentality--you might not guess, reading her, that humpback whales sing for their own purposes, and not strictly to awaken noble and loving thoughts in the humans who happen to overhear them--her exaltation at living at the water's edge, close to wild animals and the wild ocean, rings true. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>In this, her first book, essayist Servid combines the experiences of a childhood spent among medical missionaries in India with those of her adulthood in Alaska. The contrasts provided by such an unusual combination are very effective. Quietly reflective in style, Servid slips easily from insightful observations of natural beauty to memoir and back again as we are led lovingly though the landscapes and the human lives that she intertwines so effectively. Through her evocative description and her choice of material, Servid succeeds in imparting an underlying sense of spiritual exploration as well. Some passages, such as her description of a very close encounter with a whale, are fascinating in their glimpse of natural activities not otherwise accessible to many readers. Although not an essential purchase, this work is recommended for public libraries, particularly those with large nature-writing collections.DAngela M.

She&#x2019;d kept the Prince of Wales&#x2019;s guests waiting a full quarter hour while her maid, Gentry, finished dressing her hair. The cream-�and-�gold room was filled with the chatter of her most intriguing enemies and friends. The men were elegant in black evening dress and the ladies like a bouquet of tulips in their draped pastel gowns. Every head turned as Jennie Churchill swept through the doorway. The genteel chatter ceased. More than one gentleman ran his eyes the length of her figure; a few women gasped. Was her appearance that spectacular?<br><br>She glanced at her reflection in the towering looking glass over the mantel. She had ordered the blood-�red damask from Worth in Paris, and it was the very latest fashion: skirt gathered flat against her pelvis and flared at the rear in a half bustle, with a demi-�train that flirted across Sandringham&#x2019;s Aubusson carpets. Falls of black lace and jet graced the plunging neckline. Gentry had piled her thick black hair high on her head and left a few curls trailing at the nape. A seven-�pointed Cartier star glittered with diamonds on her brow. It was the only jewel Jennie owned, but she was famous for it.<br><br>Yes. That spectacular.<br><br>She smiled secretly at her reflection and sank into a curtsey deep enough to encompass the entire room.<br><br>Consuelo, Viscountess Mandeville, winked back at her. Minnie Paget, another old friend, turned away and redoubled her efforts to charm Harry Cust. But it was Jennie he was staring at over Minnie&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking well, Jane.&#x201d; The Marquess of Hartington came toward her with a glass of sherry. &#x201c;That color suits you. Matches the flush in your cheek.&#x201d;<br><br>Hart always called her Jane; it was a mark of affection. As he was old enough to be her father and in love with another woman, she laughed at him and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been squabbling with my maid. She made me scandalously late. How was the shoot today, Hart?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Damnably wet.&#x201d; He handed her the glass. &#x201c;You should have come out with us. Fresh air and mud would do you good.&#x201d;<br><br>Spring storms had deluged Sandringham all week. The gentlemen played billiards and potted rabbits when the weather was bad. The ladies gathered in the library and the morning room, writing letters and trading gossip and making faint gestures at needlework none of them gave a fig about. Jennie was used to riding in London nearly every morning and she longed to tear through the Norfolk fields. Her body ached tonight with restlessness.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing will keep me indoors tomorrow,&#x201d; she confided, smiling up at Hart, &#x201c;if I have to scrape the mud from my boots with a chisel. Are you taking me into dinner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe that honor is mine,&#x201d; Harry Cust broke in.<br><br>&#x201c;You bounder!&#x201d; George Curzon protested, with a hand on Harry&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;You know we tossed for the privilege, and I won!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; Hartington said warningly. &#x201c;It does not do to make a prize of the lady. Particularly when your Prince is present.&#x201d;<br><br>Jennie glanced swiftly toward the fire, where Bertie, the Prince of Wales, surveyed her with heavy-�lidded eyes and thumbs thrust in his waistcoat pockets. In most En�glish households, guests entered the dining room by order of social precedence. Not at Sandringham. Bertie liked to buck convention, and he loved women in Worth gowns. They were unabashedly feminine&#x2014;�one reason Jennie had ordered the red damask. Bertie&#x2019;s wife, Princess Alix, wasn&#x2019;t allowed to patronize French dressmakers. Her mother-�in-�law, Queen Victoria, thought it unpatriotic.<br><br>&#x201c;We shall draw lots for Lady Randolph,&#x201d; Bertie said deliberately.<br><br>A titter of interest followed his words. The cluster of men around Jennie fell back. The Prince summoned a footman. A pen. A pad of paper. He jotted down the names of his male guests and dropped the twisted squibs into a silver ewer. Then he offered it to Jennie with a slight bow.<br><br>She reached into the ewer&#x2019;s depths, twirling her fingertips among the possibilities. Her lips were parted, her long-�lashed eyes swooped lazily at half-�mast. Minnie Paget, her thin brows soaring to her hairline, was muttering behind her fan to the Duchess of Manchester. Jennie was pleased to note that Louise Manchester looked merely bored.<br><br>She withdrew a slip of paper and offered it triumphantly to the Prince.<br><br>He grunted, and passed it to Hartington.<br><br>&#x201c;Count Charles Kinsky,&#x201d; the Marquess read aloud, and turned his head to the far end of the double drawing room.<br><br>Jennie followed his gaze.<br><br>A dark-�haired young man whose face tugged at her memory was studying her in a way she recognized: both assessing and caressing at once. He had not been present at breakfast or tea.<br><br>&#x201c;A new arrival,&#x201d; she said, ignoring the leaping flame at her heart.<br><br>&#x201c;He won the Grand National last month,&#x201d; Hart told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you over to him.&#x201d;<br><br>Jennie had heard a good deal about Charles Kinsky&#x2014;�or more accurately, about Count Karl Rudolf Ferdinand Andreas F�rst Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau, as the Austrian peerage called him. He was the eldest son of Prince Ferdinand Kinsky, a knight of the Holy Roman Empire. Charles held a minor post at the Austrian embassy, but his job was far less important than his family pedigree, or his father&#x2019;s palaces in Vienna and Prague, or the stud farms his dynasty cultivated in the pastures of Bohemia. The Equus Kinsky&#x2014;�the Kinsky Horse breed&#x2014;�supplied the Austro-�Hungarian imperial cavalry, and all of Europe knew it. Blue blood had run in Kinsky veins since the twelfth century.<br><br>He stood carelessly in the Prince&#x2019;s drawing room as though it were the platform of a railway station and he had somewhere else to be. Kinsky was blue-�eyed and tall, with a straight nose and a dashing hussar mustache. His perfectly fitted evening clothes, Jennie guessed, had come from Henry Poole, the Prince&#x2019;s Savile Row tailor. She found the contrast between him and Bertie almost painful. Queen Victoria&#x2019;s son was forty-�two years old, bloated with self-�indulgence and incipient coronary disease. Kinsky was just twenty-�five: elegant, athletic, and whipcord-�lean. He had won the premier En�glish steeplechase a few weeks before at Aintree on his own horse, Zoedone, jumping her viciously round a field so muddy that it brought all but three contenders to their knees.<br><br>No amateur had ever won the Grand National. When Kinsky triumphed at Aintree, Jennie saw his face suddenly in all the sporting magazines and some of the ladies&#x2019; weeklies as well. Clubs concocted drinks they called &#x201c;the Kinsky&#x201d; and toasted him whenever he passed through their doors. Jennie&#x2019;s friends begged for his presence at their balls and round their dining tables and, it was rumored, in their beds. He was chary with his time and attention. It had taken weeks for Alix, Princess of Wales, to lure him to Sandringham.<br><br>Jennie&#x2019;s pulse quickened as the Marquess of Hartington led her to the Count. She had been a guest at Sandringham for three days already. She knew every single person wandering through the great house and had nearly exhausted her fund of trivial conversation. That must be why her heart leapt at the sight of Kinsky, she decided; he was a welcome diversion. He couldn&#x2019;t be worse than the tedious spring weather. She dropped him the curtsey due to a minor royal.<br><br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve met before,&#x201d; Kinsky protested.<br><br>&#x201c;Have we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ireland, County Meath,&#x201d; he said immediately. &#x201c;Lord Langford&#x2019;s estate, Summerhill. Four years ago. Your husband&#x2019;s family hosted the Empress Elisabeth. I was in her party.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you remember.&#x201d; Jennie lifted her brows.<br><br>&#x201c;How could I forget? You were the only woman in that wild country wearing a riding habit by Redfern.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good Lord, how could you tell?&#x201d; She had discovered the sporting tailor years before, in Cowes; now no lady in En�gland would hunt in anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;Like you, my mother is a magnificent horsewoman. She taught me to recognize quality and elegance&#x2014;�wherever I find it.&#x201d;<br><br>Did he intend the compliment? Delighted, Jennie laughed at the Count and allowed him to carry her into the dining room.<br><br>It was an intimate space for a royal household, the walls lined with Madrid tapestries after the style of Goya, dark and vivid. A fire crackled at one end. Kinsky led Jennie around the long table, set for twenty, assessing the place cards. He found hers and without hesitation picked it up. &#x201c;Do you know what I remember most from that time in Ireland?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The Empress&#x2019;s leather riding habit? Or the fact that she was sewn into it each morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The sapphire-�blue gown you wore the night we danced together. You looked glorious. More like a panther than a woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A wild beast, Count? Should I be flattered or insulted?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Neither. I&#x2019;m simply telling the truth.&#x201d; He exchanged her place card for the one next to his own. &#x201c;Indulge me, Lady Randolph. It&#x2019;s long past time we got to know each other.&#x201d;<br>Dinner at Sandringham never lasted more than an hour. That night Jennie found it far too short. The soup and fish and saddle of mutton passed in a blur; her wineglass was effortlessly refilled; she turned with regret from Kinsky on her right to the Earl on her left; and when the ladies rose to follow Princess Alix, leaving the men to their port, she paced alone before the great fireplace in Bertie&#x2019;s saloon as the other women talked indolently among the velvet sofa cushions. She was frustrated with herself. What was so instantly dazzling, so absorbing and consuming, about Count Kinsky? She knew hundreds of men&#x2014;�men of power, intelligence, fashion. Some of them had gone down on their knees, begging her to be their mistress. So why, suddenly, had this man caught her interest?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told you&#x2019;re an American,&#x201d; Kinsky had said over dessert, &#x201c;but no one with your command of French grew up in New York. When did you live in Paris?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mamma settled us there for her health when I was thirteen.&#x201d; It was the standard explanation for her parents&#x2019; separation, but Mamma had never been ill a day in her life. She&#x2019;d been sick of Papa&#x2019;s opera singers.<br><br>&#x201c;And suffered at the hands of a governess?&#x201d; Kinsky guessed.<br><br>&#x201c;I was sent to a convent school.&#x201d; When she&#x2019;d rather have gone riding each day with Papa back at Jerome Park. &#x201c;I caused endless trouble for the nuns.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you did.&#x201d; His warm blue gaze met Jennie&#x2019;s. Disconcerting; most dinner partners kept their eyes firmly on their plates. &#x201c;That explains the French. You were young, and the young pick up languages effortlessly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your En�glish is just as good,&#x201d; she countered.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. My father was a diplomat before me. I was raised as much in London and Paris as on my own estates.&#x201d;<br><br>My own estates. That was part of what made Charles fascinating&#x2014;�he was one of those men who ruled the earth, or at least a good swath of it. He expected to have whatever he wanted. Her husband, Randolph, was similar&#x2014;�a duke&#x2019;s son, in the habit of ordering people around. But younger sons owned nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s when I first met Sisi&#x2014;�your Empress Elizabeth,&#x201d; Jennie observed. &#x201c;I was fifteen, and we hunted together at Compi�gne. She treated me like a daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you were in France during the Prussian invasion?&#x201d; Kinsky asked suddenly, frowning. He must have hazarded her age and done a few sums. The invasion, a dozen years ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Not quite. We caught the last train out of Paris,&#x201d; Jennie supplied, &#x201c;ahead of the cavalry. Our maid was supposed to follow. She never did.&#x201d; Marie had simply pocketed the train fare and lived on in the empty house, selling the Jerome family&#x2019;s belongings piece by piece to survive. &#x201c;We managed to cross to Dover and install ourselves at Brown&#x2019;s Hotel, like the other refugees.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So much for the convent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Jennie flashed him a smile. &#x201c;I was seventeen by that time, and straining at the leash. But poor Paris! The Prussian Siege was bad enough. The Commune that followed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You saw that, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mamma insisted on returning to France once the war was over.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For her health,&#x201d; Kinsky suggested, amused.<br><br>&#x201c;A mistake, Count, from which Mamma eventually recovered.&#x201d;<br><br>The enchanting city in ruins. Sixty-�five thousand people buried in mass lime pits on the outskirts. The Bois de Boulogne, through which Jennie had galloped almost every day, cut to the ground for firewood. The Tuileries Palace a heap of smoking rubble.<br><br>&#x201c;You have a gift for survival, Lady Randolph.&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugged. &#x201c;Americans are hard to kill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And eventually you settled in En�gland ?&#x201d;</p><h2>Zig Zag Girl</h2><p>DI Edgar Stephens and a stage magician called Max Mephisto both served in a shadowy unit known as &#39;the Magic Men&#39; during the war.

They lost 446 airmen and 53 planes, but Philip Ardery&#39;s plane came home. This pilot was to take part in many more raids on Hitler&#39;s Europe, including air cover for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. This vivid firsthand account, available now for the first time in paper, records one man&#39;s experience of World War II air warfare. Throughout, Ardery testifies to the horror of world war as he describes his fear, his longing for home, and his grief for fallen comrades.

Like classic biographies of Emily Dickinson and Edna St. Vincent Millay, this fascinating book reveals Lawrence in all her complexity and establishes her, at last, as one of the premier gardeners and gardening writers of the twentieth century.<br><br>"In this first biography of the renowned gardening writer Elizabeth Lawrence, Emily Herring Wilson reminds us that even quiet lives hold unsuspected passions. Written with graceful clarity, sensitivity, and empathy, this life is a perennial."--Linda H. Davis, author of <i>Onward and Upward: A Biography of Katharine S. White</i><br><br>Elizabeth Lawrence (1904-1985) lived a singular, often contradictory life. She was a traditional southerner; a successful, independent garden writer with her own newspaper column and numerous books to her credit; a dutiful daughter who cared for her elders and lived with her mother; a landscape architect; a passionate poet; a friend of literary figures like Eudora Welty and Joseph Mitchell; and a very private woman whose recently discovered letters illuminate aspects of her mystery. Lawrence earned many fans during her lifetime and gained even more after her death with the reissue of many of her classic books. When Emily Herring Wilson edited a collection of letters between Lawrence and famed <i>New Yorker</i> editor Katharine S. White in Two Gardeners, she found legions of readers who were eager to know more about the legendary Lawrence.<br><br>Now, one hundred years after her birth, <i>No One Gardens</i> Alone tells for the first time the story of this fascinating woman. Like classic biographies of literary figures such as Emily Dickinson and Edna St. Vincent Millay, this book reveals Lawrence in all her complexity and establishes her, at last, as one of the premier gardeners and garden writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>Emily Herring Wilson is the author of numerous books, including <i>North Carolina Women</i>, and is the editor of <i>Two Gardeners: Katharine S. White and Elizabeth Lawrence-A Friendship in Letters</i>. She is a frequent lecturer and a MacDowell Colony fellow. She lives and gardens in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.This is the biography of Elizabeth Lawrence that we have all been waiting for. Even though Lawrence's writings are legendary among southern gardeners, her personal life has always been somewhat elusive. Emily Herring Wilson deftly weaves together Lawrence's passions-her gardens, family circle, cherished friendships, and even her religious beliefs-in a compelling narrative.--Judith B. Tankard, Landscape Institute, Harvard University<br><br>"Elizabeth Lawrence, who was my friend and mentor, would be delighted with Emily's Wilson's writing style and sensitive approach. Steeped as she is in the lore and history of the Southeast, Wilson is the perfect biographer for this southern lady."--Pamela Harper, author of <i>Time-Tested Plants</i><br><br>"The great merit in Emily Wilson's biography of Elizabeth Lawrence is the meticulous piecing together of the facts of Lawrence's life--the people who influenced and goaded her, her gardening correspondents, and her inquisitive and determined mind-all of which set the stage for the garden observations and writings that have become American classics." --Bobby J. Ward, author of <i>The Plant Hunter's Garden: The Explorers and Their Discoveries</i><br><br>"Elizabeth Lawrence's life, like her gardens and her writing, reflects the richness that comes from patient observation and acceptance of life's most evanescent changes. Emily Herring Wilson has captured Lawrence's 'gardener's spirit' with all its interior complexity, joy of discovery, and delight in sharing. Wilson is cautious not to trample or invade, but with candor and insight she uncovers the gardener's own bloom-time and poetic voice. This biography unlocks Lawrence's secret garden as only another gifted southern poet and writer could do." --Linda Lear, author of <i>Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature</i><br><br>"A touching, insightful, and always engaging account of the complicated life of a talented southern woman finding her way over the course of the twentieth century. Based on painstaking research and extensive interviews, Wilson places the professional life of Elizabeth Lawrence, the ultimate gardener's icon, within the larger context of Elizabeth Lawrence, the living, breathing, gracious-but-fallible, irritating-but-illuminating daughter, friend, and author we wish lived next door."--Michele Gillespie, Kahle Associate Professor of History, Wake Forest University</p><h2>The One Inside</h2><p><b>The first work of long fiction from the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright&#x2014;a tour de force of memory, mystery, death, and life.<br> &nbsp;</b><br> This searing, extraordinarily evocative narrative opens with a man in his house at dawn, surrounded by aspens, coyotes cackling in the distance as he quietly navigates the distance between present and past. More and more, memory is overtaking him: in his mind he sees himself in a movie-set trailer, his young face staring back at him in a mirror surrounded by light bulbs. In his dreams and in visions he sees his late father&#x2014;sometimes in miniature, sometimes flying planes, sometimes at war. By turns, he sees the bygone America of his childhood: the farmland and the feedlots, the railyards and the diners&#x2014;and, most hauntingly, his father's young girlfriend, with whom he also became involved, setting into motion a tragedy that has stayed with him. His complex interiority is filtered through views of mountains and deserts as he drives across the country, propelled by jazz, benzedrine, rock and roll, and a restlessness born out of exile. The rhythms of theater, the language of poetry, and a flinty humor combine in this stunning meditation on the nature of experience, at once celebratory, surreal, poignant, and unforgettable.</p><p><b>Sam Shepard</b>&nbsp;was the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of more than fifty-five plays and three story collections. As an actor, he appeared in more than sixty films, and received an Oscar nomination in 1984 for&nbsp;<i>The Right Stuff</i>. He was a finalist for the W. H.

He died in 2017.The One Inside<br><br>They&#x2019;ve murdered something far off. Fighting over it. Yes. Screaming. Doing their mad cackle as they tear into its softness. He&#x2019;s awake&#x2014;�5:05 a.m. Pitch black. Distant coyotes. Must&#x2019;ve been. He&#x2019;s awake, in any case. Staring at rafters. Adjusting to &#x201c;place.&#x201d; Awake, even after a full Xanax, in anticipation of small demons&#x2014;�horses with human heads. All small, as though life-�size were too big to fathom. His dogs are on the muscle, howling from the kitchen in feral imitation. Vicious cold again. Blue snow biting at the windowsills: glowing in what&#x2019;s left of the full moon. He throws the blankets back with a bullfighter&#x2019;s flourish and swings both bony knees out into the raw air. He comes, almost immediately, to a straight-�backed sitting position, both hands flat on his thighs. He tries to take in the ever-�changing landscape of his body&#x2014;�where he resides? Which part? He peers down at his very thick, blue, thermal hiking socks, pilfered from some movie set. Piece of some costume&#x2014;�some character, long forgotten. They&#x2019;ve come and gone, these characters, like brief, violent love affairs: trailers&#x2014;�honey wagons&#x2014;�morning burritos&#x2014;�craft service tents&#x2014;�phony limousines&#x2014;�hot towels&#x2014;�4 a.m. calls. Forty-�some years of it. Too big. Hard to believe. Too vast. How did I get in here? His aluminum trailer rocks and sways in the howling Chinooks. His young face staring back at him through a cheap 4 x 4 mirror, surrounded by bare light bulbs. Outside, they&#x2019;re shooting film of grasshoppers, falling in great swirling cones from the belly of a rented helicopter. They actually are. In the background&#x2014;�winter wheat, as big around as your thumb, blows in rolling waves.<br><br>Now, perched on the very edge of his firm mattress, staring down at his thick blue socks, white puffs of breath vaporizing in the morning dark, he knows it&#x2019;s all come true. He just sits like that for a while&#x2014;�straight-�backed. A great blue heron waiting for a frog to rise.<br><br>The house doesn&#x2019;t creak; it&#x2019;s made of concrete. Outside, the aspens moan. He doesn&#x2019;t feel the cold now. It crosses his mind that it&#x2019;s been over two years since the very sudden breakup with his last wife. A woman he&#x2019;d been with for almost thirty years. Crosses his mind. Pictures. The source? &#x201c;Am I whining now?&#x201d; he asks himself, in the voice of a small boy. A boy he remembers, but not him. Not this one, now, quaking in blue thermal socks.<br><br>s<br><br>6:00 a.m.: Wind just now quit after furious blowing out of the south, for three days straight. Air still and much warmer. House even feels hot. Thought&#x2014;�today I&#x2019;m exactly one year older than my father was when he died. Weird thought, as though it were some kind of achievement rather than raw chance. Rather than happenstance. Pull off black silk long-�handles. Female. Electric-�blue crackles of static. I see sparks shooting from my chest. Electricity is in me. Take the many pills prescribed by acupuncturist. Line them all up. Colors. Shapes. Sizes. Don&#x2019;t even know what they&#x2019;re for. Just do what you&#x2019;re told. Somebody must know something. Do what you&#x2019;re told. First light cracks through the pi�ons. Dogs, dead asleep on the kitchen floor, splayed out like they were caught suspended in a gallop. Make coffee in old stained pot. Dump yesterday&#x2019;s grounds. Mice rustling in heat vents, searching for warmth. Thinking about Nabokov&#x2019;s answer to why he writes&#x2014;�&#x201c;aesthetic bliss&#x201d;&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s all&#x2014;�&#x201c;aesthetic bliss.&#x201d; Yes. Whatever that means.<br><br>Tiny Man<br><br>Early morning: They deliver my father&#x2019;s corpse in the trunk of a &#x2019;49 Mercury coupe, dew still heavy on the taillights. His body is wrapped up tight in see-�through plastic, head to toe. Flesh-�colored rubber bands bind it at the neck, waist, and ankles&#x2014;�mummy style. He&#x2019;s become very small in the course of things&#x2014;�maybe eight inches tall. In fact, I&#x2019;m holding him now, in the palm of my hand. I ask them for permission to unwrap his tiny head, just to make sure he&#x2019;s truly dead. They allow me to do this. They all stand aside, hands clasped behind their tailored backs, heads bowed in a kind of ashamed mourning but not something you would question them on. It&#x2019;s smart to keep on their good side. Besides, they seem quite polite and stoic now.<br><br>The Mercury idles with a deep penetrating rumble I can feel through the soles of both shoes. I remove the rubber bands carefully and uncover his face, peeling the Saran Wrap away from his nose very slowly. It makes a sticky sound like linoleum coming free from its glue. His mouth opens involuntarily&#x2014;�some delayed response of the nervous system, no doubt, but I take it as a last gasp. I put my thumb inside and feel his rough gums. Little ripples where his teeth used to be. He had no teeth in life, either&#x2014;�the life I remember him in. I re-�wrap his head in the plastic sheathing, replace the rubber bands, and hand him back over, thanking them all with a slight nod, trying to stay in keeping with the solemnity of things. They take him carefully from me and place him back in the dark trunk with the other miniatures. There are shrunken women wedged on either side of him retaining all their alluring features in perfect detail: high cheekbones, eyebrows plucked, lashes caked in blue mascara, hair washed and coifed, smelling like ripe cane sugar. His is the only tiny body that faces completely out toward a band of sunlight. When they close the trunk this band goes to black, as though a cloud has abruptly covered the sun.<br><br>They stand in a semicircle facing me now, hands clasped over their groins, casually yet formally. I can&#x2019;t tell if they&#x2019;re ex-�Marines or mobsters. They seem a mixture of both. I salute each one, rotating counterclockwise. I have the impression that some even click their heels, fascist style, but I may be making this up. I don&#x2019;t know if this rain just started or if it&#x2019;s been going on for some time. I watch them drive off in a light drizzle.<br><br>That&#x2019;s about all I can remember. Along with these smattered details is a strange morning grief, but of what, I can&#x2019;t say.<br><br>Felicity<br><br>In another language, in another time, her name meant &#x201c;happiness,&#x201d; I guess. &#x201c;Felicity,&#x201d; I think it was&#x2014;�&#x201c;Felicity&#x201d;&#x2014;�yes, that was it. I&#x2019;d never heard that name before&#x2014;�like from an English novel. Very young. Freckle faced. Red hair. Slightly plump. Adolescent. Always wearing simple cotton one-�piece dresses that looked homemade. She&#x2019;d scream like a trapped rabbit when she sat backward on my father&#x2019;s cock. I&#x2019;d never heard such ecstasy and horror, all at once. I&#x2019;d listen from the next room, staring at the ceiling. Something smelled like eucalyptus and Vaseline. They never talked. I&#x2019;d listen. But they never talked. I&#x2019;d dare myself to go in there, just go in and appear and don&#x2019;t say a thing. Just stare like some zombie child&#x2014;�a child who just shows up from out of nowhere. What could they do? Stare back. Kick me out? Put on clothes and kick me out? I knew what they were doing, I knew it felt good. I knew it must feel good to be inside another person. Deep inside like that.<br><br>I went in and there she was. My father&#x2019;s girlfriend sitting ramrod straight&#x2014;�naked almost&#x2014;�as though she were riding a pony backward. Neither of them noticed me. They never turned to see me. She just kept on riding him and screaming recklessly, working her way up and down in a frenzy. He was on his back on a table, staring at the ceiling, his arms folded behind his head, like he might be taking a siesta or listening to the radio. His lips were moving but nothing came out. I walked right up next to them but they never turned to see me. Her pink underwear were on the floor. They looked like they belonged to an older woman, maybe her mother.<br><br>There was a frantic knocking and banging at the door but neither of them paid any attention. Felicity just kept screaming and pumping away. Sometimes she would lean slightly forward, look down, and examine the penetration closely, without passion. Her mouth was open wide and her hair stuck to the sweat on her forehead. The knocking and banging went on. I went to the door and cracked it. I had my jockey shorts and T-shirt on. It was Mabel Hynes, the landlady, from down the hall. She stood there with a Mexican hairless in the folds of her flabby arms. The dog was silent but kept its ears pricked for each scream. When the scream came, the dog yapped.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on in there? Sounds like someone&#x2019;s getting murdered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s just my dad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your dad? What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just having fun. He&#x2019;s got a friend with him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fun? Doesn&#x2019;t sound like fun to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen her before, actually. This girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, tell him if he doesn&#x2019;t find a way to keep the noise down, I&#x2019;m calling the cops.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Pilgrim of Hate: A Mediaeval Whodunnit</h2><p>Back cover text:<br>Pilgrims are gathering from far and wide to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the translation of Saint Winifred's bones to the Benedictine Abbey at Shrewsbury. In distant Winchester, a knight, supporter of the Empress Maud, has been murdered - not apparently an event of importance to those seeking miraculous cures at the saint's shrine. But among the throng some strange customers indeed begin to puzzle Brother Cadfael - and as the story unfolds it becomes evident that the murder is a much less remote affair than it first seemed.</p><p>ELLIS PETERS (1913-1995) was the nom de crime of English novelist Edith Pargeter, author of scores of books under her own name. She was a recipient of the Silver Dagger Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award, conferred by the Crime Writers Association in Britain, as well as the coveted Edgar, awarded by the Mystery Writers of America.This entry in Peters&#39;s Brother Cadfael series finds the sixteenth-century monk hosting pilgrims who have traveled to Shrewsbury to commemorate the translation of St. Winifred&#39;s bones to the Benedictine abbey. The murder of a knight has political implications which reach Cadfael and involve him and some of the pilgrims in a mystery. Stephen Thorne, who has recorded several of Cadfael&#39;s adventures from Chivers, skillfully evokes the time and place with a fully voiced performance.

I can imagine there are some situations in life where amnesia would be pretty useful, right?</b></p><p></p> Well, when you have it and don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on, it&#x2019;s pretty grabbling frustrating. Once you know why you have it, and IF you are lucky enough to have given it to yourself, and IF you have a failproof way to get your memory back, it&#x2019;s pretty exciting. Still frustrating, but good to know that it&#x2019;s all for a reason. Did I mention you feel pretty stupid, too? I mean--you don&#x2019;t even know who you are!<p></p> <b> I bet golems are pretty handy, too--can you tell us how you made yours? </b><p></p> Hmmm. Let&#x2019;s see. I won&#x2019;t give you the full recipe, but I can tell you that my latest golem, Raven, was made from several parts bird (the Chihuahuan Raven species, to be exact--for its booming voice, navigational abilities, and superior lingual skills), circuitry from a discarded cash register (for simple math skills), extra-strength parabolic synth tubes (for muscle mass), super-long lasting chewing gum (we don&#x2019;t want her getting tendonitis, do we?), various devices I &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; from my mom (her garage door opener, curling iron, and blender), and finally a thermo-reducer distilling apparatus that cools volatile material (this golem needs to keep her cool in heated situations!). All that got blended with some real bad luck--and a golem is born! (Again!)<p></p> <b> You&#x2019;re known for your skills with a slingshot. Can you give us any slingshot-maintenance tips? </b><p></p> <ol><li> Replace the elastic regularly (or better yet, use surgical tubing). This will keep proper torque and prevent backfire, misfire, or breakdown when you need it the most. <br> </li><li> Depending on the size of your rig, adding a tasteful bicycle grip to the shaft can improve handling, and thus your aim (and confidence). <br> </li><li> I find that a few basic modifications (time-reverse, teleport, x-ray vision) can really add value to a simple slingshot. <br> </li><li> Keep your gear out of the sun. It dries out the elastic, makes the wood brittle, and shrivels your soul. </li></ol><p></p> <b>If Nee-Chee, Mystery, Sabbath, and Miles wrote a book about your Lost Days, what would they say?</b><p></p> <ol><li> NEECHEE: You&#x2019;ve gone through a lot of trouble just to make more trouble for yourself. <br> </li><li> MYSTERY: Blackrock is such a magical essence, any effort to protect it would be worthy.<br> </li><li> MILES: It was a nice return to the alley.

New York was the city that embodied the spirit and strength of a newly powerful America.&nbsp; <br><br>In 1924, in the vibrant heart of Manhattan, a fierce rivalry was born.&nbsp; Two architects, William Van Alen and Craig Severance (former friends and successful partners, but now bitter adversaries), set out to imprint their individual marks on the greatest canvas in the world--the rapidly evolving skyline of New York City.&nbsp; Each man desired to build the city&#x2019;s tallest building, or &#x2018;skyscraper.&#x2019; Each would stop at nothing to outdo his rival.<br><br>Van Alen was a creative genius who envisioned a bold, contemporary building that would move beyond the tired architecture of the previous century.&nbsp; By a stroke of good fortune he found a larger-than-life patron in automobile magnate Walter Chrysler, and they set out to build the legendary Chrysler building.&nbsp; Severance, by comparison, was a brilliant businessman, and he tapped his circle of downtown, old-money investors to begin construction on the Manhattan Company Building at 40 Wall Street.&nbsp; <br><br>From ground-breaking to bricklaying, Van Alen and Severance fought a cunning duel of wills. Each man was forced to revamp his architectural design in an attempt to push higher, to overcome his rival in mid-construction, as the structures rose, floor by floor, in record time.&nbsp; Yet just as the battle was underway, a third party entered the arena and announced plans to build an even larger building.&nbsp; This project would be overseen by one of Chrysler&#x2019;s principal rivals--a representative of the General Motors group--and the building ultimately became known as The Empire State Building.<br>Infused with narrative thrills and perfectly rendered historical and engineering detail,<i> Higher</i> brings to life a sensational episode in American history. Author Neal Bascomb interweaves characters such as Al Smith and Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, leading up to an astonishing climax that illustrates one of the most ingenious (and secret) architectural achievements of all time.</p><p>"As a builder of perhaps more skyscrapers than anyone, I know a lot about them; yet Neal's book is very informative. This is a great and fascinating read for anyone interested in architecture, history, and New York City."<br>-Donald J. Trump <br><br>"Neal Bascomb's HIGHER is a fascinating account of the bitter race between two 1930's Manhattan architects to build the world's tallest building and thereby set in place a significant part of the fabulous skyline that inspires us to this day. Full of intrigue, insider's detail, and rich characterization, HIGHER is delicious history with a human face--a must-read primer on how THE city came to be."<br>-Les Standiford, author of <i>The Last Train to Paradise</i>.<br><br>"In Higher, Neal Bascomb has captured the very engaging human drama of architects and entrepreneurs scheming and competing to build the tallest skyscraper in New York--and in the world. Their legacies still stand proud, the Chrysler and Empire State buildings being among the greatest artistic and structural engineering achievements of all time."<br>-Henry Petroski, author of <i>Engineers of Dreams <br></i><br>"Characters and buildings alike come vividly to life in Neal Bascomb's account of ambition, greed and technical ingenuity during the Roaring Twenties. An enthralling tale, brilliantly told, of the greatest architectural adventure of the twentieth century."<br>-Ross King, author of <i>Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling</i> and <i>Brunelleschi's Dome</i><br><br>"The great race to build the world's tallest building still continues in Asia, but nowhere was the gamble undertaken with such intense competition as New York in the twenties and thirties. Out of it came iconic structures that define the city's profile and inspire generations of designers. Neal Bascomb's exploration of the struggle for supremacy among the Chrysler, Empire State, and 40 Wall Street buildings reveals how strong personalities, powerful economic forces, and shifting design aesthetics influenced those who sought to dominate the sky in New York. In his compelling narrative each building comes to a different result, but their interdependence is compellingly documented and convincingly presented. Anyone interested in the three tall buildings that make New York special with want this book."<br>-Hugh Hardy, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates LLPNeal Bascomb is a former journalist and book editor.

It contains more than three hundred illustrations in full color.<br> <br>In the 1800s, long before the days of photojournalism and television, colorful up-to-date pictures of news events, portraits of important political and social figures, and scenic views of American natural wonders were circulating widely all through the country. From early in the exciting century that saw a small nation expand into a mighty world power, the famous lithographic firm of Nathaniel Currier and James Merritt Ives produced over 7,000 lithographs picturing scenes of American life, portraits of American leaders, and dramatic re-creations of the events that make the news of the day.<br> <br>Each Currier &amp; Ives print was individually colored by hand, and the skilled craftsmanship as well as keenness of observation make Currier &amp; Ives prints among the most collectible of Americana.<br></p><p><b>Walton Rawls</b> is the author of several books in the field of American popular culture, most notably <i>Wake Up, America!: World War I and the American Poster.</i> Trained at Harvard in American history and literature, Rawls was a contributor to the <i>Oxford Companion to American Military History</i> and is a member of Atlanta's Civil War Round Table.<br>Excerpt from: <b> <i>The Great Book of Currier and Ives' America</i> </b> <br> <br>A Currier &amp; Ives catalog of the 1870s explained that long experience in the lithography trade had made the company "thoroughly acquainted with the wants of the Public, and the best methods of producing good pictures at a small expense." The prints were not, of course, made on the premises of the busy retail shop but in a "factory" around the corner on Spruce Street, first at No. 2 (an address the company used as the sole imprint on certain political cartoons&#x2014;lest someone think the Currier &amp; Ives firm partisan) and then at No. 33, until the dissolution of the venerable concern in 1907.<br> <br>No. 33 Spruce Street was a five-story factory building, of which Currier &amp; Ives had leased the third, fourth, and fifth floors for producing what another catalog called, "The Best, the Cheapest, and the Most Popular Pictures in the World." The third floor was devoted entirely to hand-powered printing presses based on the Senefelder prototype, and several more of them were set up in the midsection of the fourth floor, which had its Spruce Street side, or front, given over to facilities for preparing proper drawing surfaces on the lithograph stones. Called "graining," this process was full-time work at Currier &amp; Ives for one man, who had to remove all traces of any previous lithograph on the stone and ultimately produce an even-textured, almost velvety surface that would "take" every nuance of the various crayons used by a lithographer. Basically this was accomplished by grinding one flat stone against another in a circular motion while gradually reducing the coarseness of sand grains sprinkled between the two stones. The rear, or north side, of the fourth floor, where the light was better, was the domain of the artists, lithographers, and letterers.<br> <br>Most of the best-known artists associated with the Currier &amp; Ives firm over the years were not native Americans nor full-time employees. Only English-born Frances (Fanny) Flora Bond Palmer, whose artistic capabilities ranged from rural American scenery to Mississippi River steamboats, from domestic architecture to flower arrangements, was on the payroll any great length of time&#x2014;some thirty years. Nathaniel Curriers early associate Napoleon Sarony, who was born in Canada and excelled at historical pictures, left the firm in 1846 to form his own company with Henry B. Major, another Currier employee. At the beginning of the Civil War, German-born Louis Maurer, blessed with a gift for drawing horses and figures, parted with Currier &amp; Ives after eight years to join Major &amp; Knapp, successors to Sarony, Major &amp; Knapp when Sarony sold out his interests and departed for Europe. Charles Parsons, best known for the famous "Central Park&#x2014;Winter, The Skating Pond," was brought to this country from England as a child and apprenticed to Endicott &amp; Company, a lithography firm established in 1828. During his thirty years at Endicott, Parsons also handled work, especially marine prints, farmed out to that company by Currier &amp; Ives. In 1863 he became head of the art department at Harper &amp; Brothers, where he employed Thomas Worth, who made his first sale of a drawing directly to Nat Currier. Worth seems to have been the largest single contributor to the Currier &amp; Ives list, having originated almost all of The Darktown Series. The remaining artists of note among the regulars&#x2014;Englishman Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait, highly regarded for his scenes of hunting and fishing in the Adirondacks; George Henry Durrie, without peer in the limning of winter farm life in New England; and James E. Butterworth (also English), who specialized in marine paintings&#x2014;were never directly employed by Currier &amp; Ives but sold paintings individually for reproduction.<br> <br>The Currier &amp; Ives lithographers, whose job it was to recreate selected sketches and paintings on the stones from which they were to be printed, shared the north side of the fourth floor at No. 33 Spruce Street with the artists. Their role in producing salable lithographs was an exacting one. Duplicating an oil painting on a textured stone surface&#x2014;in reverse&#x2014;with greasy, black crayons of varying thickness and hardness was a task that permitted few mistakes and hardly any erasures. Even accidentally touching the stone with a sweaty fingertip could leave an impression sure to appear as a smudge in the finished print. Nevertheless, lines gone astray in unimportant areas of a design could be scraped from the stone, but it was not possible to rethink a line, remove it, and then redraw it. A serious mistake meant that the stone had to be reground. Some of the regular artists, like Louis Maurer and Fanny Palmer, were expert lithographers as well, but generally the job of putting a drawing or painting "on stone" called for talents beyond the mere artistic&#x2014;such as patience, concentration, and a steady hand. Even a small stone was likely to take longer than a week to prepare for printing.<br> <br>The entire fifth floor of the Currier &amp; Ives factory was devoted to brightly hand-coloring the black-ink lithographs produced on the third and fourth floors. The work was in the skilled hands of a supervisor and a dozen or so talented young immigrant girls (mostly German) with some kind of earlier artistic training. They were seated at arms length from each other at long worktables, and each young lady was instructed to apply a single color to a print in all the areas it was to appear before sliding it along to the next girl&#x2014;and the next color. Eventually the evolving picture would reach a senior colorist entrusted with handling the most difficult passages, who would also touch up earlier work where necessary. There was always a model print to follow that the original artist or Fanny Palmer had colored to the satisfaction of one of the partners. However, this assembly-line process was restricted to producing the cheaper small&#x2013; and medium&#x2013;sized prints, and in times of heavy demand its output could be significantly increased. For instance, in rushing to get a Civil War battle scene on the market while the news was still fresh, a back-up force of less-skilled girls was called in to apply preliminary coloring by stenciling washes over broad areas&#x2014;a line of boldly charging Union troops might have all their uniforms colored blue in one brushstroke! The effects of these washes were supplemented by the regular girls, who would more carefully paint the prominent figures and add touches of bright color to battle flags, bleeding wounds, and muzzle blasts before passing the print on to the finisher. After all, not much effort could be profitably spent on a product meant to wholesale at just six cents apiece.<br> <br>The large prints (averaging about two feet by three feet) were always sent out for coloring to well-trained artists who specialized in this work. However, even they were given a fully colored model approved by Currier or Ives to follow. Usually the colorists were given a dozen plain prints at a time, and, at mid-century, the fee to be earned for coloring them was a dollar a dozen. These large prints (done by the firms best artists) generally retailed from $1.50 to $3.00, depending on their complexity or their market, but occasionally they went as high as $6.00. Today, a rare and desirable print such as "The Life of a Hunter. A Tight Fix" would bring over ten thousand dollars if it ever came up at auction.<br> <br>Nathaniel Currier continued to resist all advice to "modernize" his operation with facilities for actually printing the company's famous lithographs in color. Chromolithography, as the new color process was called, had made great advances in the 1860s, but Currier remained devoted to the hand-coloring that had served the firm so well. After all, Currier &amp; Ives was still Americas most popular printmaker: "our Prints have become a staple article...in great demand in every part of the country." "In fact," as a catalog of 1872 boasted, "without an exception, all that we have published for the past thirty-eight years (and they comprise several thousand) have met with a quick and ready sale."<br> <br>In 1872, Currier &amp; Ives gave up is retail shop of thirty-four-years duration for smaller quarters at 125 Nassau Street. Two years later, the firm had moved into 123 Nassau, and, three years after that, in 1877, it was operating out of 115 Nassau, where it remained for another seventeen years. In 1880, Nathaniel Currier, then sixty-seven years old, retired from the famous company founded by him nearly fifty years earlier. The prosperous half-century he had spent in lithography also had been a period of fantastic development and change for the hundred-year-old American republic. Its westernmost frontier had moved in that time from the Missouri River all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The population of a still-growing America had more than tripled&#x2014;from fifteen million to fifty million. New York, the nations largest city, had burgeoned from 300,000 to 1,200,000 inhabitants. To reach the Pacific coast shortly after Currier opened his shop was a journey that consumed months, whether by prairie schooner across the Great Plains or, in the 1850s, by noble clipper ship around the Horn; in 1880 it took only six days by transcontinental railroad. Up to 1835, there had been no such thing as illustrated news; no quick way for the man in the street to grasp the horror of a distant catastrophe; no way that the urban mechanic could easily picture what a buffalo looked like (or a Mississippi River sidewheel steamboat); no way for a matron of modest circumstances to afford a colorful print for her parlor; no easy way for a Middle Border schoolmarm to help her pupils visualize the exciting events of our nations founding. However, Nathaniel Currier had a hand in changing all of that.<br> <br>"Old Hickory" was still President when Currier launched his series of "Cheap and Popular" prints&#x2014;the first colorful and artistic pictures a Jacksonian "common man" could ever afford to own. The simple nature and wide variety of these prints over the years incidentally schooled our citizens in what it meant to be American. Curriers dramatic historical pictures brought to life for everyone the stirring highlights of Americas proud beginnings (as well as contemporary battles of the Mexican and Civil wars). His innovative political banners effectively met the widespread publics need to know what its leading presidential candidates looked like, and the company's topical cartoons offered (as they were advertised) a democratic selection of "hits at the weak points of all the candidates, policies and parties." The many city and landscape views issued by Currier &amp; Ives presented Americans with a wide-ranging panorama of the manmade and natural wonders of their remarkable country; and the clipper ship, locomotive, steamship, and yacht prints testified to the American genius for inventing and perfecting, and to their love of speed. There were also bucolic scenes of planting and harvest, reminding the harried city-dweller of mans natural (and more perfect?) state; as well as provocative prints of Barnum freaks and notorious entertainers like Lola Montez, tempting the bumpkins to visit the "sinful" city; and "Comic Colored Pictures" that would "drive away the blues, and promote health by hearty and wholesome laughter." The sportsman or armchair adventurer was treated to sylvan scenes of comradeship and hunting in the Adirondacks, to jolly fishing trips on Long Island Sound, to prints of important horse races and other sporting events, and to the romance of panning gold in the Sierra Nevada and of following our westward expansion through lands roamed by wild Indians and buffalo. The ladies were offered a wide selection of tasteful flower and fruit pictures to ornament the dining room, and awesome landscapes for the parlor; they were kept abreast of the latest styles on Fifth Avenue by fashion plates, and had their moral sensibilities touched by a steady outpouring of religious and temperance prints and by gentle scenes that called to mind their innocent childhoods.<br> <br>Nathaniel Currier had retired at a time when there was yet some justification in the boast that Currier &amp; Ives' "Celebrated Mammoth Catalogue" offered "The Best, the Cheapest, and the Most Popular Pictures in the World." Although undated, this catalog was issued from the 115 Nassau Street address of 1877 to 1894, and it still presented a grand total of 1,412 different prints. There are later catalogs bearing the company's next address, 108 Fulton Street, but by then the swell of popular demand that Currier &amp; Ives had ridden so skillfully was well past its crest. Even at the peak of the firms success, a wave of the future was building rapidly, a wave that eventually washed away the old underpinnings of the hand-colored lithograph. It was not a tidal wave that arrived without warning; its signs were clearly visible for a long time. Currier had had them pointed out more than once, but perhaps most poignantly in an incident reported to Harry T. Peters by Ives' son Chauncey. One day in the 1860s, Curriers old friend P. T. Barnum strode into 152 Nassau Street with the midget Tom Thumb perched on his shoulder, a sure way to attract the publics attention. Barnum was there to discuss a new lithographed portrait of his tiny sideshow attraction to use in promotion. In the middle of the conversation, Thumb interrupted: "Barnum," he said, "I have a better idea. Lets go uptown to Sarony's, and Ill pose for a photo. He does all the big boys, and these old lithos are out of date."<br> <br>Indeed, during the late 1860s photographic portraits by Mathew Brady, Napoleon Sarony, and others had become a social necessity, and a collecting mania for carte-de-visite photographs of the famous was well underway. At his death in 1896, Napoleon Sarony, the most fashionable portraitist of the time, left a collection of 40,000 photographs of actors and actresses, not to mention 170,000 portraits of notables in other fields. Earlier, in the 1850s, another exciting invention of growing popularity had entered the market, a device that caused especially paired photographs to appear in three dimensions when viewed through its eyepiece. By 1863, one firm, E. &amp; H. T. Anthony &amp; Company, offered more than 1,100 examples of Americas famous sights and natural wonders for viewing by stereoscope, or stereopticon. Also in the 1850s, lively illustrated periodicals began to appear with wood-engravings more timely, more numerous, and more skillfully done than ever before&#x2014;magazines like <i>Harper's</i> and <i>Gleason's Pictorial Drawing&#x2013;Room Companion</i> and <i>Frank Leslies' Illustrated Newspaper.</i>The significant advantages still held for a time by Currier &amp; Ives prints in portraiture, scenic views, and pictorial coverage of the news were their vivid coloring and low price. However, these final attractions were greatly diminished by the perfecting of chromolithography in the 1860s and rapid improvements in steam-powered printing, which by 1871 had brought forth a press capable of 1,800 impressions per hour.<br></p><h2>The Frugal Gourmet</h2><p>All the incredients that make THE FRUGAL GOURMET one of the most popular cooking shows on television are in this bestselling cookbook, including: a complete range of cooking techniques, advice on kitchen equipment, special hints and tips, exciting ideas for vegetarian meals, PLUS more than100 illustrations of recipes and techniques.</p><p></p><h2>Knitting in the Nordic Tradition</h2><p>Shows traditional patterns for sweaters, shirts, jackets, shawls, scarves, caps, mittens, and stockings, discusses wools, yarns, and knitting tools, and examines geometric and floral designs</p><p>Vibeke Lind is the author of <i>Practical Modern Crochet</i> as well as <i>Knitting in the Nordic Tradition</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish</p><h2>Miss Withers Regrets (Rue Morgue Vintage Mysteries)</h2><p>When Inspector Oscar Piper asks his old friend Hildegarde Withers to stop meddling in murder, she surprisingly agrees.

This dictionary is no exception. It was last issued in 2001, but instead of updating, the publisher has acquired a completely new work. There are still approximately 35,000 entries but now almost 3,000 images (the previous edition had 1,100 illustrations, most of them photographs) and numerous differences in layout and design, making for a livelier, if also denser looking, page. Entries contains the usual elements, such as parts of speech, pronunciation, and variants and inflected forms, but otherwise bear little resemblance to those in past editions, with a different arrangement, different definitions, sample sentences, word histories, and usage notes. There are no synonyms, which comparable dictiionaries have. Other changes include feature panels on topics such as geothermal regions, killer whales, and optical illustions. Users will no longer find entries for place-names or the fairly detailed &#34;Story of English&#34; at the beginning of the volume, and the reference section at the back of the volume is a bit skimpier (no more thesaurus, no more weights and measures). This dictionary remains a good choice for the older children in its designated age range. The many illustrations, some of which take up half a page, add interest and will invite browsing. Children at the lower end of the range will have an easier time with The American Heritage Children&#39;s Dictionary (2003), which has simpler definitions and a less-crowded design. Quinn, Mary EllenWith 35,000 entries, 1,100 color photographs and a reference section including a thesaurus and maps of the world, the Macmillan Dictionary for Children 4th Revised Edition makes a handy resource. Other features include spelling hints, brief etymologies for selected words, and expanded illustrations with labeled parts. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>I Knew You Could!

I never wanted it to end and I'm going to be on pins and needles until the next book in The Graveyard Queen Series comes out." -Fresh Fiction<br><br>"The Restorer is by turns creepy and disturbing, mixed with mystery and a bit of romance. Amelia is a strong character who has led a hard and-of necessity-secret life. She is not close to many people, and her feelings for Devlin disturb her greatly. Although at times unnerving, The Restorer is well written and intriguing, and an excellent beginning to a new series." -Misti Pyles, Fort Worth Examiner<br><br>The beginning of Stevens' Graveyard Queen Series left this reviewer breathless. The author smoothly establishes characters and forms the foundation of future storylines with an edgy and beautiful writing style. Her story is full of twists and turns, with delicious and surprising conclusions.

Using a huge cache of recently released documents and exclusive interviews, Pincher makes a compelling new case that&#x2013;as he has long believed&#x2013;the head of Britain&#x2019;s own counterintelligence and security agency was himself a double agent, acting to undermine and imperil the U.K. and America. Written with the power of a heart-pounding thriller, Treachery pulls the mask from intelligence leader Roger Hollis. As a result, years of traitorous action and inaction on his watch come tumbling down.<br><br>Pincher reveals Hollis&#x2019;s early years, when he was schooled at Oxford, which &#x201c;educated&#x201d; many agents, and worked in 1930s Shanghai, a hotbed of soon-to-be spies and Soviet recruiters. Hired by MI5&#x2013;at a time when there was virtually no vetting of employees&#x2013;he was a gray presence who rose in the ranks over twenty-seven years while, Pincher suspects, he was allowing the most notorious Soviet spies of the century to flourish.<br><br>Myriad fascinating case histories are portrayed here, including that of Lt. Igor Gouzenko, a Red Army cipher clerk who said cryptically in 1945 that there was a mole in MI5 with access to important files. Pincher also provides exciting new perspectives on the most infamous operatives of our time, including Kim Philby and Klaus Fuchs. Perhaps most explosively, Pincher posits that long after Hollis stepped down, a cover-up was perpetrated at the highest levels, and that Margaret Thatcher was induced to mislead Parliament to prevent the truth from coming out.<br><br>An essential volume for a world potentially facing a new cold war as Russia dangerously flexes its military and espionage muscles once again, Treachery warns us to protect our society and institutions from enemy infiltration in the future. This is a revelatory work that puts twentieth-century politics and war into stunning new relief.</p><p>Chapman Pincher is the most experienced and perhaps the best-known British espionage writer. Born in India in 1914, he was educated at King&#x2019;s College London and the Royal Military College of Science. His book <i>Their Trade Is Treachery,</i> which first charged Sir Roger Hollis with being a Soviet agent, was a sensation. For decades he has been the most effective critic of the British security system, and over the years he has broken scores of stories that have created headlines.<i>Chapter One<br>A Momentous Message<br></i><br>Late in the year 2000, vladimir putin, president of the Russian Federation, awarded the posthumous title &#x201c;Superagent of Military Intelligence&#x201d; to Ursula Beurton, a former British housewife who is better known in the annals of espionage by her Soviet code name, Sonia. It was an unprecedented honor for a woman who had already held two Orders of the Red Banner for her treacherous activities in several countries, especially in Great Britain, where she had been deeply involved in the theft of both British and American atomic bomb secrets during World War II. Shortly after she died, in Berlin in 2000 at the age of ninety-three, some of her other exploits were released from the Moscow archives for publication in Russian books. One of them, which had occurred in Oxford in 1943 under the noses of MI5, then located nearby, involved information so politically explosive that it was regarded by the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, as requiring the utmost secrecy.<br><br>In August 1943, Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, accompanied by senior aides, met in Quebec to decide about the date and details of the invasion of Italy from North Africa and, later, of France from Great Britain. In addition, on August 19, they signed a separate agreement concerning collaboration between Britain and the United States on the production of an atomic bomb. The American atomic proj?ect was progressing so rapidly that Churchill wanted British scientists to join it there, but the U.S. government had objected to such a move. Previously, in June 1942, at a meeting in Washington, D.C., Churchill and Roosevelt had made a loose arrangement to pool atomic information and develop a bomb together, but with the setting up of the vast Manhattan Project, the United States was contributing so much more money and effort that the will to share the proceeds had seriously declined. At Quebec, Churchill was determined to exploit his friendship with Roosevelt to resurrect the partnership and enshrine it in a formal treaty.<br><br>The old warrior&#x2019;s persistence resulted in a separate two-page document, usually referred to as the Quebec Agreement. In it, the two leaders stated that Great Britain and the United States would collaborate to produce an atomic weapon and would never use it against each other or against any other country without mutual consent. It also declared that neither would ever communicate any information about it to any third party without joint consent. There was also agreement about continuing atomic collaboration in the postwar situation.<br><br>The Quebec Agreement was an exceptionally sensitive document because the very existence of any work on the bomb was supposedly so secret that it referred to the project only as &#x201c;Tube Alloys.&#x201d; Also, Churchill and Roosevelt were most anxious to avoid offending the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, by making him aware that he would not be given any information about the new weapon, which could devastatingly weaken the Soviet Union&#x2019;s military position in the postwar world. Having been forced into becoming allies by Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s attack on them in 1941, the Russians were bearing the brunt of the fighting.<br><br>Churchill therefore kept the Quebec Agreement and its details secret to himself, a few trusted aides, and the Chiefs of Staff of the British Armed Forces. The distribution list&#x2014;those to whom a copy was sent for information&#x2014;is therefore likely to have been very restricted indeed. Several documents now in the British National Archives testify to the extraordinary extent of the measures taken to prevent unauthorized persons from having any knowledge of its details. As late as June 1949, the prime minister, then Clement Attlee, expressed his deep concern that details of the Quebec Agreement and subsequent secret accords might be revealed to a U.S. Senate committee, from which they might leak. Even in 1951, both Attlee and President Harry Truman were still insisting that details of the agreement should remain secret. A statement about the Quebec Agreement made in Robert Norris&#x2019;s heavily researched biography of the American general Leslie Groves, Racing for the Bomb, provides further evidence of the desired secrecy: &#x201c;Only a few senior officials on each side of the Atlantic knew of the highly secret arrangement. For several years after the war the existence of the agreement was not known either to the American Congress or the British Parliament.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet the Russian archives have now shown that on Saturday, September 4, 1943&#x2014;only sixteen days after the signing&#x2014;Sonia, sitting in Oxford, supplied the Red Army Intelligence Center with an account of all the essential aspects of the Quebec Agreement, along with ancillary details, sending them directly to Moscow by radio.<br><br>The scene for this astonishing achievement was a cottage, 50a George Street in Oxford&#x2019;s Summertown district, once occupied by the coachman serving a large house from which it was separated by a stone wall. Having taken her miniature high-tech radio transmitter from a cavity in the wall, in which it was normally hidden, Sonia, then thirty-six, was sitting at a table downstairs. It was late at night, and the obligatory blackout curtains, required to eliminate the smallest chink of light observable by a German bomber, ensured her total privacy. Laboriously, she had already converted the document she had surreptitiously acquired, letter by letter, into a code believed to be unbreakable. Having completed the encoding and rechecked it, she began to tap it out in Morse.<br><br>The high aerial she had strung up with the permission of the owner of the big house&#x2014;ostensibly to service her large conventional radio set&#x2014;ensured that her efforts reached Red Army intelligence, generally known as the GRU. There, her masters and Stalin himself quickly rated her coup as &#x201c;of the greatest value&#x201d; because &#x201c;for the first time&#x201d; the military and political leadership of the Soviet Union knew that the United States and Great Britain were creating an atomic military alliance and were going to hide it from its wartime ally. The GRU archives record, &#x201c;On 19 August 1943, in a secret personal message to Marshal Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill reported about their agreed plans for the surrender of Italy and other matters but there was no word about the fact that they had also made an additional secret agreement about the use of nuclear weapons.&#x201d;<br><br>What Stalin regarded as his allies&#x2019; perfidy inevitably affected his attitude when, on November 28, he met Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran to discuss both the war and the postwar situation. The Western leaders were hoping to establish better relations with the Soviet dicta- tor, who, according to newspapers, had arrived in a &#x201c;prickly, suspi- cious mood.&#x201d; Historians may wonder to what extent his suspicion was fortified&#x2014;and his later behavior conditioned&#x2014;by deep resentment generated by his knowledge that his country had just been secretly excluded from a project likely to change the military parameters forever, as he already knew from his atomic spies. Did Stalin interpret his exclusion as the first icy gust of the cold war to come? To this day, Russian writers regard it as an inexcusable British-American &#x201c;dirty trick&#x201d; on a gallant ally that had absorbed the impact of the German savagery with tremendous losses.<br><br>In 2006, the release of the private papers of Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin&#x2019;s most trusted deputy, revealed that on October 15, 1943, a British spy had also supplied details of the early plans for Operation Overlord, the Anglo-American assault on Normandy. These, too, had been agreed upon at Quebec. Stalin&#x2019;s array of British traitors, serving both the GRU and the other arm of Soviet intelligence, most commonly known as the KGB, had been instructed to seek out the secret results of the conference. One of them&#x2014;described in a GRU report to Molotov as &#x201c;our source of trusted credibility&#x201d;&#x2014;had quickly responded with plans and maps of landing beaches. They included the estimate that this &#x201c;second front,&#x201d; which should reduce German pressure on the Soviet forces, was unlikely to be attempted before the spring of 1944. Small wonder that Stalin was &#x201c;prickly and suspicious&#x201d; at Tehran.<br><br>There were potentially more dangerous consequences. Once the plans for Overlord were in Soviet hands, there was always the risk that they might leak to Germany, through a spy in the Kremlin, a defector, or a captured Russian general. In view of Stalin&#x2019;s dream of a totally Communist Europe, there was even the possibility that if, by the spring of 1944, the German forces were in full retreat out of the Soviet Union, it might suit him to leak the plans deliberately.<br><br>Whether Sonia appreciated the scale of her achievement is unknown because she never mentioned it to anyone and, probably on Soviet orders, withheld it from her memoirs. Her son Michael Hamburger, with whom I am in regular contact, was astonished when I told him about it in 2003. That she experienced a glow of satisfaction cannot be doubted, because in the previous month, after managing to make an espionage assignment in London in a violent storm, she had received special praise from her Moscow chief in a message stating that if he had more Sonias, the war would be over much sooner. Her Quebec coup was extraordinary for another reason: She was so heavily pregnant that she gave birth only four days later. In a letter to her mother written on September 8, she announced the birth of her second son.<br><br>The GRU archives show that Sonia also included the fact that some senior Americans, both military and scientific, had reservations about any atomic partnership with Britain. So she had clearly been given a summary of all the atomic aspects of the Quebec Agreement, which had been circulated in secrecy in some British government department and abstracted by some high-level traitor.<br><br>How d...</p><h2>The legend of the Christmas rose</h2><p>William H. Hooks&#39;s evocative retelling of this unusual Christmas legend transports readers back two thousand years to Bethlehem to follow nine-year-old Dorothy on her journey to see the Baby Jesus and to witness the miracle of a tiny white flower delicately transforming into the beautiful Christmas rose. Richard A. Williams&#39;s lush oil paintings evoke the beauty and joy of the first Christmas.</p><p>William H. Hooks is the author of fifty-two books for children, including <i>The Legend of the Christmas Rose</i>, illustrated by Richard A. Williams, <i>The Ballad of Belle Dorcas,</i> illustrated by Brian Pinkney, and <i>Freedom's Fruit,</i> illustrated by James Ransome. He lives in Chapel Hill, NC.The plant <i>Helleborus niger</i>, long used for its medicinal properties, became known as the Christmas Rose in a legend involving Christ's birth. In Hooks' lovely and fresh version, Dorothy, the little sister of three grown shepherds, desperately wants to see the newborn. Despite being forbidden to go, she follows her brothers, who, having heard from heavenly angels the news about the baby, take their prize lamb as a gift. Suddenly Dorothy realizes she has no present for the baby. When she begins to cry, an angel appears waving a small white flower, and soon the ground is blanketed with the little flowers. These Dorothy carries to Jesus, who is pleased and touches them, turning them pale pink. Williams' glorious paintings, stunning in their realism and rich with light and shadow, will very likely make this delightful book a Christmas favorite.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<p>I</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lerial looks up from the half-written report before him, thinking, <i>Saltaryn, if you only knew how all your efforts to improve my writing with precise statements are being corroded by the requirements of being post captain.</i> Then he concentrates on the words he has just written.</p> <p>&#x2026; the Afritan Guard continues to patrol the top of the ridge one kay north of Ensenla. They occasionally stray across the marked boundary. They do not stay on the south side of the boundary for long, and they refrain from crossing when a Mirror Lancer force larger or roughly equivalent to the Afritan force is present&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>He shakes his head. <i>They&#x2019;re not quite taunting us, but what can you do?</i> At the same time, he worries about what he writes, because he had earlier sensed, not that much after dawn, a number of riders leaving the Afritan Guard post to the north, and now he waits for his scouts to return and report.</p> <p>Lerial glances from the dispatch he is writing, the required summary of Eighth and Eleventh Companies&#x2019; evolutions and other events occurring over the previous eightday, to the dispatch he had received two eightdays earlier.</p> <p><i>From:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jhalet, Commander, Mirror Lancers</p> <p><i>To:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lerial, Captain, Ensenla Post</p> <p><i>Date:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Twoday of Winter, 593 A.F.</p> <p><i>Subject:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Border Patrols</p> <p>Please find attached a map of the border between Afrit and Cigoerne, as agreed to by Duke Kiedron and Duke Atroyan. These borders are to be respected. Duke Kiedron has affirmed that no Mirror Lancer company is to cross them, even under extreme provocation. All officers and squad leaders are to be familiar with the borders and to conduct patrols in such a fashion that no Mirror Lancer evolution can be taken as provocative or as an encroachment upon Afritan lands.</p> <p>Duke Atroyan has issued a similar proclamation to the Afritan Guard. Should the Guard inadvertently trespass, all Mirror Lancer squads and/or companies should offer the Guard the opportunity to retreat before resorting to arms. That opportunity need not be offered should any Afritan force commence hostile actions on the lands of Cigoerne.</p> <p>If such hostile action is commenced on the lands of Cigoerne by Afritan or other forces, whatever response may be necessary shall be determined by the officer or squad leader in command of the Mirror Lancer force so attacked. In no case, however, shall a Mirror Lancer force knowingly enter the lands of Afrit. The sole exception to this directive is that a company commander or more senior officer may commission a force to recover Mirror Lancers carried into Afritan territory.</p> <p>Any attacks by Afritan forces are to be reported expeditiously to Mirror Lancer headquarters, as are any border crossings for the purpose of recovering personnel. Such reports must contain the time, the location, and the complete scope of forces, both Mirror Lancer and others, involved in the action.</p> <p>Lerial returns his attention to his own report and continues to write. A third of a glass later, he signs the report and eases it aside to let the ink dry before folding and sealing it for dispatch. He considers all that has happened over the past four years&#x2014;and all that has not&#x2014;ever since the people of Ensenla all fled Afrit over less than an eightday and subsequently rebuilt the town, or much of it, in the duchy of Cigoerne&nbsp;&#x2026; and then demanded the right to continue to till their lands and tend their flocks on their ancestral hills.</p> <p>Duke Atroyan&#x2019;s response had been quick&nbsp;&#x2026; and disastrous for the Afritan Guard. Lerial shakes his head, recalling the events that followed. Thankfully, over the last four years, he has not been required to use such force. The upside of the &#x201c;effect&#x201d; of such a storm has been that Duke Atroyan could suggest that the deceased field commander had been unwise to attack in such weather&nbsp;&#x2026; and lay the blame there, with no word about the fact that the duke himself had ordered the attack while his brother, the arms-commander of Afrit, had been either inspecting the ironworks at Luba or ill with a severe flux&nbsp;&#x2026; at least that is what Lerial has gathered over the years, from listening and from veiled hints from his aunt Emerya, who has her own sources. But the downside of letting a freak storm take most of the blame for the deaths of over five hundred men is that at least some officers in the Afritan Guard are wagering that such a freak storm is unlikely to occur again&nbsp;&#x2026; and they are tired of being restrained from pursuing the growing numbers of refugees who have fled to Cigoerne, many of whom have been skilled crafters. Nor has Duke Atroyan grown more patient as time has passed&nbsp;&#x2026; which is why Commander Jhalet issued the order that rests on Lerial&#x2019;s desk. It is also why Lerial has insisted on training one squad from each company to use horn bows similar to those used by the Verdyn Lancers&#x2014;even if it took some pressure by his sire to get permission for that&nbsp;&#x2026; and well over a year of training.</p> <p>Lerial has no desire to unleash the power of unbinding linked order and chaos again&nbsp;&#x2026; and he has been fortunate in not having to do so. <i>But how long will you be able to refrain?</i></p> <p>Cigoerne has grown to almost half again its size in five years, and places like Penecca, the &#x201c;new&#x201d; Ensenla, and Teilyn, as well as others that had been barely more that hamlets or small towns, now are far more than that, and the factors in Cigoerne have added two more river piers to handle the trade from all over Hamor, and even from Candar and Austra.</p> <p>A rap on the study door breaks through his momentary musing. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Captain, the watch reports the scouts are at the crossroads.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;ll be out in a moment.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial checks the dispatch, thinks about folding and sealing it, then snorts softly. <i>No point in doing that until you hear what the scouts have discovered&nbsp;&#x2026; or not.</i> He rises and leaves the study, stepping into the small anteroom of the Ensenla Post headquarters building and walking to the duty desk.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ser.&#x201d; The duty ranker looks up.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have something later for a dispatch rider. Let the duty squad know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, ser.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Lerial then walks out into the cold wind blowing out of the southwest and stands waiting for the scouts to ride into the post and report. He does not wait long.</p> <p>The two Mirror Lancers in their greens and heavy riding jackets&#x2014;and gray gloves&#x2014;rein up outside the headquarters building. Both have red faces from the cold and wind. &#x201c;Tie your mounts. You can report where it&#x2019;s warmer.&#x201d; Lerial smiles. He can recall every winter he has spent in Ensenla, and how much he appreciated the few days of leave spent at the palace in Cigoerne.</p> <p>Once the three are seated in his study, Lerial nods to Vominen, the former Verdyn Lancer who transferred to the Mirror Lancers as soon as he could, even before the Verdyn Lancers became Mirror Lancers and ceased to exist as a separate force. &#x201c;You look like something has happened.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not that the scout looks that way, but that Lerial can sense the patterns of order and chaos that flow around him, and the turbulence of those patterns is suggestive.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ser&nbsp;&#x2026; almost all of the Afritan Guard pulled out of the north Ensenla post just after dawn this morning.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; Lerial grins. &#x201c;Or did you sneak over there?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t call it sneaking, ser. Just rode over and asked one of the herders. Besides, there was no one about, and they do the same when they can.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I rode almost to the gates. They&#x2019;re barred. No one&#x2019;s in the watchtower. No smoke from the chimneys. No smoke in midwinter, ser?&#x201d; Vominen shakes his head.</p> <p>&#x201c;What did you see, Naedar?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Same as Vominen, ser. One of the herder boys said they took three wagons, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial nods slowly.</p> <p>After another third of a glass with the two scouts, Lerial feels they have told him everything they can recall, and he dismisses them. He looks to the dispatch he had written earlier. <i>You&#x2019;ll need to rewrite that and send it off immediately.</i></p> <p>Why&nbsp;&amp; why in the name of the Rational Stars would Rhamuel pull three companies of guards from Ensenla when for the past two years those guards have been patrolling the border and looking for any excuse to provoke the Mirror Lancers into a skirmish?</p> <p>Lerial can think of only two reasons&#x2014;a crisis in Swartheld, even an armed uprising, since Duke Atroyan has been far from the most effective ruler of Afrit, or an attack on Afrit, most likely on Luba or even Swartheld itself, by the forces of Duke Khesyn of Heldya. Either of those events would be far worse for Cigoerne than another Afritan attack on Ensenla or anywhere else along Cigoerne&#x2019;s northern border.</p> <p><i>Could there be other reasons?</i> Quite possibly, although Lerial has no idea what they might be, only that it&#x2019;s unlikely that they would be any better than the alternatives that he already suspects are the reasons for the Afritan withdrawal.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by L.

Mayan art and architecture were the inspiration for the spectacular cut-paper artwork.</p><p>David Wisniewski (wiz-NESS-key) was born in Middlesex, England, in 1953. After training at Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College, he spent three years as a clown, designing and constructing his own props, costumes, and gags. He was subsequently hired by his future wife, Donna, as a performer with a traveling puppet theatre. Married six months later, the Wisniewskis started their own troupe, Clarion Shadow Theatre, specializing in shadow puppetry. In the course of creating the plays, puppets, and projected scenery, Mr. Wisniewski evolved the storytelling techniques and art skills that eventually led to his picture books with their unique cut-paper illustrations. His retelling of GOLEM was awarded the 1997 Caldecott Medal. David Wisniewski died in 2002 in the Maryland home he shared with his wife and two children.Grade 1 Up-- An unusual story of a young Mayan ballplayer who, defying the priest's prophecy of a drought to come in the year ahead, challenges the rain god (Chac) to a game of pok-a-tok (a Mayan basketball/soccer game played on an outdoor court). Equipping himself with the speed of a jaguar (sacred animal to his people), the strength of a beautiful long-plumed Quetzal, and the hidden power of a sacred underground spring, the boy outperforms Chac. The god rewards him by sending gentle showers after his victories on the court. Wisniewski's exquisitely rendered cut-paper illustrations--more intricately crafted than those he created for The Warrior and The Wise Man (Lothrop, 1989)--contain depth and shadows, giving the appearance of an action-filled play. Their harmonious hues are those of the natural world that is the basis of Mayan existence: the browns, grays, and terra cottas of the earth; the blues of the sky and water; the ochres of the sun; and the greens of the foliage. In several places, though, the story skips from one scene to the next, as if the text were written to support the illustrations. Nevertheless, the great beauty of the volume and its lessons on Mayan culture make it a unique and worthwhile purchase. --Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Not-Just-Anybody Family (Blossom Family)</h2><p>When Junior Blossom wakes up in the hospital, his&nbsp;&nbsp;last memory is of crouching on the barn roof with&nbsp;&nbsp;cloth wings tied to his arms, and of Maggie and&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern in the yard below, urging him to fly. That had&nbsp;&nbsp;been just before Junior spotted a police car&nbsp;&nbsp;approaching the farm in a cloud of&nbsp;&nbsp;dust.<br>Meanwhile Pap, the children's grandfather, sits in&nbsp;&nbsp;disgrace in the city jail. He was arrested for&nbsp;&nbsp;disturbing the peace after his pickup truck&nbsp;&nbsp;accidentally dumped 2,147 beer and soda cans (worth&nbsp;&nbsp;$107.35) on Spring Street.<br>With their&nbsp;&nbsp;mother away on the rodeo circuit, it's up to Maggie&nbsp;&nbsp;and Vern to find a way to rescue Pap and Junior.&nbsp;&nbsp;How will they solve their family problems?</p><p>Betsy Byars, a native of Charlotte, North Carolina, received a degree in English from Queens College there. Currently, she lives in Clemson, SC with her husband, a college professor. They have four grown children--one son and three daughters--and five grandchildren. &#34;My own hobbies,&#34; Byars says, &#34;are rather quiet. I like to read and do needlework, and I love animals. But my husband has some very interesting hobbies, and through him, I&#39;ve learned to fly and earned my pilot&#39;s license. Together, we fly all over the United States. Since our children are all grown now, we also travel a great deal in Europe, but we take commercial flights because our plane is not really equipped to make transatlantic flights.&#34;Grade 4- 7 Junior Blossom is poised on the roof of the barn, working up the courage to fly on homemade wings. His brother and sister are on the ground urging him on when Junior spots a police car coming up their road. Maggie and Vern run to hide in the woods, while Junior loses his grip on the roof and slides off, breaking both legs. The children's widowed mother is away working the rodeo circuit; Pap, their grandfather, has been arrested for disturbing the peace while he was, innocently enough, trying to retrieve the 2147 beer and pop cans that had spilled out of the back of his pick-up. Byars' characters are memorableespecially Vern, who manages to "break into" jail to be with Pap, thus causing a news sensation, and Ralphie, Junior's hospital roommate. The plot, however, is contrived in many ways. Readers are never told why police is "one of the most dreaded words in the family vocabulary," and credibility is stretched thin by Vern's jail break-in and by Maggie's and Ralphie's managing to wheel Juniorwith both legs in caststo Pap's hearing without being apprehended by hospital personnel. While this is not Byars' strongest book, the off-beat characters, crisp dialogue and fast-paced action will keep readers turning the pages. Connie C.

In 1961, she joined the Royal Shakespeare Company playing Anya in The Cherry Orchard with John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft. In 1968, she went beyond the classical stage to become a sensation as Sally Bowles in Cabaret, adding musical comedy to her repertoire. Over the years, Dench has given indelible performances in the classics as well as some of the greatest plays and musicals of the twentieth century including No�l Coward&#x2019;s Hay Fever, Stephen Sondheim&#x2019;s A Little Night Music, Kaufman and Hart&#x2019;s The Royal Family and David Hare&#x2019;s Amy&#x2019;s View (for which she won the Tony Award).&nbsp; Recently, she made a triumphant return to A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream as Titania, a role she first played in 1962, now played as a theatre-besotted Queen Elizabeth I. &nbsp;Her film career has been filled with unforgettable performances of some unforgettable women: Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown, the terrifying schoolteacher Barbara Covett in Notes on a Scandal and the writer Iris Murdoch in Iris.&nbsp; And, for the BBC, Dench created another unforgettable woman when she brought her great comic timing and deeply felt emotions to the role of Jean Pargetter in the long-running BBC series As Time Goes By.</p><p>And Furthermore is, however, more than the story of a great actress&#x2019;s career. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the story of Judi Dench&#x2019;s life: her early days as a child in a family that was in love with the theatre; her marriage to actor Michael Williams; the joy she takes in her daughter, the actress Finty Williams, and her grandson, Sammy. &nbsp;Filled with Dench&#x2019;s impish sense of humor, diamond-sharp intelligence and photos from her personal archives, And Furthermore is the book every fan of the great Judi Dench will cherish. </p></p><p>DAME JUDI DENCH is one of the foremost stage, screen, and television actors of our time.&nbsp; Honored with every award given for performances on stage and screen, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1970, created a Dame of the British Empire in 1988 and a Companion of Honour in 2005.AND FURTHERMORE (Chapter 1)&nbsp;Early days <p>1934&#x2013;1957</p><p>I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT it is more than half a century since I first stepped on to the stage of the Old Vic Theatre, and into a way of life that has brought me the most rewarding professional relationships and friendships. I cannot imagine now ever doing anything else with my life except acting, but it was not something that I actually planned when I was growing up. That may seem strange, as my whole family was deeply involved in theatre in one way or another.</p><p>My father was a doctor in general practice, but spent much of his spare time acting with the Settlement Players, a very good amateur group in York. He and my mother were keen theatre-goers, so my elder brothers and I were taken to the theatre from a very early age. When I saw the celebrated farce Cuckoo in the Nest by Ben Travers, I laughed so much when a man jumped up in a laundry basket at the end of a bed wearing those combinations they called longjohns, that I thought I would have some kind of fit. In fact I think my mother must have decided that I really was going to have a fit, because I was taken home at the interval, and only brought back the next night to see the second half of the play. We went to Peter Pan at Leeds, and when we came home I said, &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t we fix some wires up in the waiting room, and I could come flying in from the consulting room to the waiting room?&#x2019; My parents must have been in despair.</p><p>Daddy was a fine actor, and a marvellous after-dinner speaker; with a great sense of timing. He had the ease of an Irishman in telling stories, and he had a brilliant sense of humour. He was actually born in Dorset, but brought up in Dublin, and only moved to York after he married. He was so very grounded as a doctor. I used to go visiting patients with him, and as he turned into roads the children used to come and hold on to the car. He became really very popular as a GP, and we hardly ever saw him at any meals, because he was always out delivering babies. People still come up to me and say, &#x2018;You won&#x2019;t believe this, but your father delivered me as a baby.&#x2019; I always try to look surprised.</p><p>Mummy also acted occasionally, but more often was responsible for the costumes. Once they went to a party with Daddy as Shakespeare and Mummy as Elizabeth I, and she made the most incredible dress for the Queen. They were also in a film about Dick Turpin&#x2019;s ride to York, and I still have the picture of the two of them on the stairs at home. A man called Wilson, who taught me to ride, was in the film with them, and he left us a box of costumes from it, with various bodices and skirts.</p><p>Mummy could whip up anything, and after I had seen the Laurence Olivier film of Henry V I longed to go to a fancy-dress party as the Princess of France, so she made me the most beautiful dress, with cotton-wool all round the sleeve marked like ermine. I made the headdress that I had seen Ren�e Asherson wearing, with a piece of netting round my head and a ruler through the top. It looked absolutely terrific. (It never crossed my mind that one day I would play that part onstage.) Over the years there were all sorts of things that had just got put in the ottoman, which we were always digging through; I just thought that all families got dressed up like that.</p><p>When the Settlement Players did Christopher Fry&#x2019;s The Firstborn I played Tuesret, the pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter. Christopher became a great friend years later, and I rather regret that is the only time I have ever acted in one of his plays. When I was at Clifton Preparatory School we did a Nativity Play and I was told I was to play a fairy, which I was quite cross about, because I knew the Nativity story did not involve fairies. I also played a snail once, and Alice in Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>My brothers, Peter and Jeffery, who were quite a bit older than me, appeared in school productions at St Peter&#x2019;s in York, which is one of the oldest schools in the country. In Shaw&#x2019;s Caesar and Cleopatra Peter played Caesar and Jeff was Cleopatra. I saw Jeff as Kate in The Taming of the Shrew and Cassius in Julius Caesar, and Peter as Duncan in Macbeth. I thought it was very racy to spin round on the piano stool at home and say, &#x2018;What bloody man is that?&#x2019; That was all I remembered of the play, but I did say that rather a lot.</p><p>Because of the age-gap between us I was of course sent to bed much earlier than the boys, and I remember so well going to bed and hearing them playing cricket in the garden, and hearing all that life going on outside; I simply couldn&#x2019;t bear it, and it is still like that. I don&#x2019;t like missing anything, even today I hate to be in bed and hear people talking downstairs, because I am far too nosy, I have to know what they are on about.</p><p>Our house was in an area called &#x2018;York Without&#x2019;, because it was outside the city walls. We had a long straight strip of garden, with a few apple trees. We couldn&#x2019;t grow very much, apart from some lovely lilies-of-the-valley and a few roses, and we used to rake the pears off the tree next door. At the end of the garden was an old barn, and owls used to live in there. When the boys had friends round playing cricket they were always knocking the ball over into Miss Lazenby&#x2019;s garden, and she would never give the ball back, however much we asked for it. One day Jeff found a rat in the barn, and they did it all up and gave it to me to take it round and push through her door. Daddy heard about it, and told us all off.</p><p>My first school, Miss Meaby&#x2019;s, was just up the road from my brothers&#x2019; school, St Peter&#x2019;s, so when I finished for the day I used to go and sit on the wall to watch the boys playing games, waiting for my mother to come and take us home.</p><p>When I went to the Mount School in the city there were no such things as day-girls, so I had to be a boarder all the time, but I didn&#x2019;t mind that at all really. We were allowed home at weekends for just a day, but not to sleep. When games were cancelled we had to go on what was called a &#x2018;wet-walk&#x2019;, all sorts of different walks that we had to do. So I used to go out of school, ring up home, and they would come and fetch us. We would have a huge tea, then Mummy would water us in the garden with a watering-can, drop us at a corner near school, and we trudged back soaked to the skin. I don&#x2019;t think we were ever caught out.</p><p>The first play I saw at the Mount was Julius Caesar, with lots of big girls in bigger togas. I thought that was not at all a good play to do, and it is the one Roman play I have fought shy of ever since. But it was there that I first played Titania in A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream, a role I returned to with the RSC in 1962 for Peter Hall, and again in 2010 at his request at the Kingston Rose Theatre.</p><p>The teacher who had the most influence on me had been known as Joy Harvey when she had worked with John Gielgud, but at school she was called Mrs Macdonald. Her marriage had broken up, but after I left she wrote me the most lovely letter, saying that she was standing on York Station when suddenly her husband had appeared and they had got together again, years after their break-up. She seemed to me quite dissipated; she used to drink, and smoked like a chimney, but she would suddenly talk about acting in the professional theatre, and bring it all alive. She was a good laugher, but she took it very seriously, and she was a terrific teacher.</p><p>That is why I have reservations about drama students being taught by people who have never actually worked in the theatre. It has worked sometimes, for actors like John Neville and Richard Burton, but most people need somebody to tell them what it is actually like to be in a company, how you should behave, and the homework you must do, so that you don&#x2019;t take up a lot of other people&#x2019;s time.</p><p>The other teacher at the Mount who influenced me was Phoebe Brook, the art mistress. Everybody was encouraged, in whatever they did, to do it well but not to compete. Although we swam and played other sports against other schools, winning was not the important thing. That is quite important in my book. Deep down, I suppose I don&#x2019;t really approve of the awards business, even when I have won them, because you can&#x2019;t really award prizes for acting. That is not to say that when I have won awards I haven&#x2019;t been absolutely thrilled &#x2013; I have &#x2013; but I suspect deep down that it is something that goes a bit against the grain. Acting is such a personal, imperfect kind of art.</p><p>Acting was just one of the things I did at school; I originally wanted to be a ballet dancer, until Daddy said, &#x2018;Well, if you do take up dancing, by the time you are forty you&#x2019;ll have to teach or something, because you just can&#x2019;t go on for ever, it is quite a short career.&#x2019; I wouldn&#x2019;t have liked that. I don&#x2019;t like the thought of anything packing up.</p><p>For a while I wanted to be a theatre designer, and actually went to art school for several months, but then I was taken to see Michael Redgrave as King Lear at Stratford in the early Fifties, and came face to face with a theatre without a curtain. I was only used to a proscenium arch with a curtain, where they changed the set behind it in the interval. Suddenly here was this huge open stage with no curtain at all, just this enormous rough stone that was a throne at the beginning, and turned to become a hovel or a cave, or anything else that was needed. The set was designed by the team of Robert Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde, and I sat there thinking I could never ever have the imagination to do a set like that, and overnight I thought, I don&#x2019;t think I can be the kind of designer I want to be. It really was a kind of road to Damascus for me.</p><p>When I was seventeen at the Mount School, Canon Purvis did a new translation of the York Cycle of Mystery Plays, for its first revival since the fifteenth century, produced by Martin Browne, who specialised in religious dramas. He came to the Mount and asked for people to play angels, so we were all taken from school and auditioned; eight of us were chosen, and I got the part of a forgetful angel. I was meant to forget everything, and I did of course forget everything; people used to get so irritated with me. We had all-white robes with a gold collar and gold wigs.</p><p>Three years later, in 1954, I played the young man in white clothing sitting at the door of the tomb, or rather in my case not sitting, as Henzie Raeburn (Martin Browne&#x2019;s wife, who was playing Mary Magdalene) insisted that I could perfectly well crouch there while the three Marys did their scene. It actually looked quite angelic, as when I got up there was no chair to be seen. Mummy made the costumes again, Daddy played Annas the High Priest, Caiaphas was the drama teacher John Kay who taught at Bootham&#x2019;s, the Mount&#x2019;s brother school, Joseph O&#x2019;Conor played Christ, John van Eyssen the Devil, David Giles the Archangel Gabriel, and Tenniel Evans was the Archangel Michael. Mary Ure, who was in the sixth form at the Mount then, played the Virgin Mary. Three years after that, just as I was leaving drama school, Martin Browne asked me to go back and play Eve, but when I got there he said he had changed his mind and wanted me to play the Virgin Mary. Funnily enough, I followed Mary Ure in another part after a three-year gap at Stratford. She was Titania in Peter Hall&#x2019;s production of The Dream in 1959, and I played her when he revived it in 1962 with a mostly new cast.</p><p>All three productions were done in the open air at St Mary&#x2019;s Abbey, and I was always rained on. It was fine for the Creation of the World, and everything was terrific for the Fall of Lucifer, but when I came on for the Birth of Christ, it just poured down. I used to bend over when he was born, and then come up and part the straw to show the baby, and as I came up I saw people pulling their macs on and putting up umbrellas, and it seemed to happen every time, but it was still a wonderful experience.</p><p>Having abandoned my first two ideas of a career &#x2013; dancing or designing &#x2013; it is hardly surprising that I settled on acting, which was entirely due to my brother Jeff. Peter had followed in Daddy&#x2019;s footsteps and gone off to study medicine, but Jeff only ever wanted to be an actor. He didn&#x2019;t talk me into it, but it was his stories of the fun he was having at the Central School of Speech and Drama (to give it its full title just this once) that inspired me. Our parents only ever encouraged us in anything we wanted to do, but my father did say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got to get your O-and A-levels, because it&#x2019;s a very precarious life. You might have to think about something else at some time, so for goodness&#x2019; sake work hard. By all means go to Central, if that&#x2019;s what you want to do, but you&#x2019;ve got to get those exams.&#x2019; I got my A-levels in Art and English Literature, though Daddy still had to pay the fees at Central for both of us.</p><p>The audition was a written exercise, and I had tonsillitis at the time, so they sent it to me to complete at home. The question paper asked a lot about Greek theatre, which fortunately I had learnt about, though I have always taken care not to appear in any of those plays in the years since: I don&#x2019;t fancy playing in a mask.</p><p>The Central School was still based at the Albert Hall in my day, only moving to Swiss Cottage in North London after I left. We used to cut some lectures and creep into the Albert Hall to listen to people like the great Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli rehearsing. Alfred Hitchcock was filming some scenes from The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1955, and one morning we went in and James Stewart was walking towards us, dragging his mac behind him, and said &#x2018;Good morning&#x2019; to us, while we were all completely flattened against the wall. Nobody went to any lectures that day, we all stayed to watch.</p><p>I had a lovely time at Central. I stayed right across the road at a hostel run by Charis Fry, daughter of the cricketer C.B. Fry, next to the Royal College of Organists, so there were a lot of musicians and actors living there. It was only a four-minute walk to Central in the morning, and I saw every play in London during those three years. I was there with Jeremy Kemp, Philip Bond (father of Samantha Bond), Ian Hendry, Julian Belfrage (who became my agent), Vanessa Redgrave, Rowena Cooper, and Jenny Daniel (with whom I shared a room).</p><p>For the first year we weren&#x2019;t allowed to open our mouths, we just learnt to do a lot of breathing exercises and the Alexander Technique. Clifford Turner taught us dialect, and although he couldn&#x2019;t do an accent he was a brilliant voice-teacher, and so was Cicely Berry, with whom I have worked throughout my career. I used to adore movement classes with Maggie Rubell, leaping about all over the place, learning relaxation and co-ordination of the body. Nobody ever cured me of falling over, however, which I still have a habit of doing on first nights.</p><p>That marvellous old actor Walter Hudd, who was Head of Drama, told us that at some point we would be asked to do a mime, and we wouldn&#x2019;t know when it was coming, but we had better be prepared. Well of course it flew straight out of my head, and then one morning we were all sitting there, and Walter said, &#x2018;Right, this is the morning of the mime.&#x2019;</p><p>I thought, The mime? The mime! Good grief! And then Walter called me up first. I could still do it now. I thought that this could only be minimalist. I will walk into a garden that I had been in a very long time ago. So I bent down and picked something and smelt it, then I picked up a stone and threw it into a pool, and just stood there watching the pool, and then I sat on a swing, and that was all I did. At the end of all the mimes Walter gave me top marks, to my astonishment. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re like a little Renoir,&#x2019; he said to me. I will never forget it. I got this fantastic notice from him, and it was in...</p></p><h2>Bees, Wasps, and Ants: The Indispensable Role of Hymenoptera in Gardens</h2><p>Few insects are more important than bees, wasps, and ants. They maintain the garden&#x2019;s biological balance, fertilize vegetables, fruits, and flowers, and recycle nutrients within the soil. It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that a garden can&#x2019;t be understood without an understanding of its insects. <br><br><i>Bees, Wasps, and Ants</i> explores the importance of the Hymenoptera and explains how gardeners can encourage (or discourage) them in the garden. Part One includes a summary of their biology and a tour of what role they play in each part of the garden. Part Two takes a closer look at the individual groups within the family, including sawflies, horntails, woodwasps, parasitic wasps, predatory wasps, bees, and ants. <br><br><i>Bees, Wasps, and Ants</i> is sure to persuade even the most insectphobic reader to invite these fascinating creatures into their gardens. <br></p><p>Eric Grissell received his doctorate in entomology from the University of California, Davis and served as a research entomologist with the Florida Department of Agriculture and the U. S. Department of Agriculture at the National Museum of Natural History. He has published extensively in science journals and on topics of botany, horticulture, and gardening. He work earned the Garden Writers Association Garden Globe Award for Best Talent in Writing and recognition from the American Horticultural Society.If ever a group of garden creatures gets a bad rap, it&#x2019;s bees, ants, and wasps. Yet, as Grissell so strikingly points out, most of the time their negative reputation is either grossly overstated or decidedly undeserved. Although the role of the order Hymenoptera in garden settings is of vital importance, most homeowners and quite a few gardeners do whatever they can to remove nests, hills, and hives at first sight. It&#x2019;s a knee-jerk reaction that can have devastating results, for these creatures are essential for pollination, fertilization, and even pest-control. Reviewing their impact, revealing their habits and habitats, and profiling them via such inventive terms as the garden&#x2019;s &#x201c;cows,&#x201d; &#x201c;wolves,&#x201d; and &#x201c;police,&#x201d; Grissell strikes a fine balance between scientific examination and anecdotal evidence. Although not sufficiently illustrated to serve as a field guide, Grissell&#x2019;s extensive exploration of this insect order is highly informative and genuinely useful. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>The New Advanced Custom Rod Building</h2><p>Contains instructions for building a rod that is tailored to suit a specific style of fishing and demonstrates a number of sophisticated wraps and finishing techniques</p><p><b>Dale P.

For three men in particular, 1998 would become a grueling battle for a new North American birding record. Bouncing from coast to coast on frenetic pilgrimages for once-in-a-lifetime rarities, they brave broiling deserts, bug-infested swamps, and some of the lumpiest motel mattresses known to man. This unprecedented year of beat-the-clock adventures ultimately leads one man to a record so gigantic that it is unlikely ever to be bested. Here, prize-winning journalist Mark Obmascik creates a dazzling, fun narrative of the 275,000-mile odyssey of these three obsessives as they fight to win the greatest -- or maybe worst -- birding contest of all time.</p><p>A classic in the making -- an account of the biggest year in birdwatching history.<br><br>In the USA, some 50 million people lay claim to being bird-watchers or ?birders,? spending billions of dollars on birding-related travel and membership fees every year. A select, and utterly obsessed, few compete in one of the world?s quirkiest contests -- the race to spot the most species in North America in a single year. And 1998 wasn?t just a big year. It was the biggest. <b>The Big Year </b>is Pulitzer Prize-winner Mark Obmascik?s account of what was to become the greatest birding year of all time.<br><br>It was freak weather conditions that ensured all previous records were broken, but what becomes clear within the pages of this classic portrait of obsession is that while our feathered friends may be the objective of the Big Year competition, it?s the curious activities and behavioural patterns of the pursuing ?homo sapiens? that are the real cause for concern. It is a contest that reveals much of the human character in extremes. Such are the author?s powers of observation that he brilliantly brings to life and gets under the skin of these extraordinary, eccentric and obsessive birders while empathizing with and eventually succumbing to the all-consuming nature of their obsession. The result is a wonderfully funny, acutely observed classic to rank alongside the best of Bill Bryson.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Mark Obmascik&nbsp;is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist and bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Big Year</i>, which was made into a movie, and&nbsp;<i>Halfway to Heaven</i>.

Hungry for recognition, raging against the art establishment that was shutting them out, they decided to form a collective, expecting they would gain more attention as a group than as solo artists.

Thomas has managed to survive the battle of Cr�cy. Still nursing his wounds, he is dispatched by the king on a mission to look into the matter of his father's inheritance, which is obscurely connected to the Holy Grail. This most precious relic of the Christian faith is a much sought-after object, offering the power of total victory in war to its owner. But Thomas finds himself in the middle of a battle against an army invading the North of England, and other shadowy forces pursuing the grail are prepared to slaughter anyone who stands in their way. In the ruins of his birthplace, Thomas discovers more about his father, and a dangerous voyage to France brings him up against his cousin and arch-enemy, Count of Astarc Guy Vexville.

These practices continued openly into the Dark Ages, when they were suppressed and adapted into the worship of saintly bones--or continued in secret by a few &#x201c;heretical&#x201d; sects, such as the Cathars and the Knights Templar.

In particular, he reveals how Christianity originated with Jesus&#x2019;s effort to restore the sacred rites of Moses, including the <i>Marzeah</i>, or Feast for the Dead. Examining the connections between these rites and the mysterious funeral of Father Sauniere in Rennes-le-Ch�teau, the author explains why the prehistoric Cult of the Dead has held such power over Western civilization, so much so that its echoes are still heard today in our literature, film, and arts.</p><p>Earl Lee is a professor at Pittsburg State University and the author of several books, including <i>Raptured</i>, <i>Drakulya</i>, and <i>Libraries in the Age of Mediocrity</i>.

While little known today, these rites remain deeply embedded in the symbolism, theology, and sacraments of modern religion and bring a much more literal meaning to the church&#x2019;s &#x201c;Holy Communion&#x201d; or symbolic consumption of the body and blood of Christ. <br> <br>Documenting the sacrificial, cannibalistic, and psychoactive sacramental practices associated with the Cult of the Dead from the prehistoric Minoans on Crete to the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews and onward to early and medieval Christian sects, Earl Lee shows how these religious rites influenced the development of Western religion. In particular, he reveals how Christianity originated with Jesus&#x2019;s effort to restore the sacred rites of Moses, including the <em>Marzeah</em>, or Feast for the Dead. Examining the connections between these rites and the mysterious funeral of Father Sauni�re in Rennes-le-Ch�teau, the author explains why the prehistoric Cult of the Dead has held such power over Western civilization, so much so that its echoes are still heard today in our literature, film, and arts. <br> <br>EARL LEE is a professor at Pittsburg State University and the author of several books, including <em>Raptured</em>, <em>Drakulya</em>, and <em>Libraries in the Age of Mediocrity</em>. He lives in Pittsburg, Kansas.</p><h2>Remington 1894</h2><p><b>Johnstone Justice. What America needs now.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Bestselling authors William W. Johnstone and J.A.

If you were being completely honest, you're not exactly excited about going. Maybe you were up late with the kids, or you have a big project due at work in a couple of days. It feels like you've been to parties like this a thousand times. You spend the evening chatting with the other guests about typical topics such as what sports your kids are playing or upcoming vacation plans. But then you meet SEBASTIAN, who is new to the area. He's friendly and fun to talk to, and is fascinated to know you're a researcher at "Company X." It turns out he's a consultant for "Company Y." You talk about what you do for a bit, and he's very familiar with your area of expertise. You're impressed by how smart he is and it's refreshing to find someone who is interested in your work. He suggests meeting for lunch to talk more, and you happily agree. SEBASTIAN suggests an extravagant lunch spot, a place you've always wanted to go, but the cost isn't really in your budget. You talk about your work for a while-he has interesting questions and seems genuinely curious about what you do, especially related to your role on Project Y. The conversation flows, and you find out that you're both avid tennis players. SEBASTIAN asks if you're a member of X Tennis Club. You confess you've never been, you can't manage the dues while paying a mortgage and saving for the kids' college. SEBASTIAN says he'd be happy to have you as his guest. You make a date to play tennis, and SEBASTIAN insists on picking up the check.<br><br> At work later that week, there's a new development with Project Y, and you remember SEBASTIAN had been curious about that. He's been a great guy so far, buying lunch and offering to take you to his club, and so you decide to call him up and tell him about it. You're glad you did, because he seems so happy with the information-and it feels good to be helpful. The relationship continues and you and SEBASTIAN become better friends. You enjoy his company, he's fun to play tennis with, and is always up for a good meal. You also appreciate his interest in your work and you start to keep him updated on things. It turns out the information you have helps him out so much that he got you a small consulting fee. It really takes some pressure off to have extra money to put away for the kids' college.<br><br> When there's a bigger change with Project Y, and you tell him about it, your fee suddenly doubles. Now you can save for college and afford that tennis club you've always wanted to join. Your wife is thrilled, and the extra money is incredibly handy. This continues on for a while, and even though you love the extra money and enjoy SEBASTIAN's company, you have moments when you wonder if you should be giving SEBASTIAN this information; what's he doing with it? But you really don't want to give up the money, especially since your wife has started redoing your kitchen. SEBASTIAN has been a good friend, and is so knowledgeable about Y already, surely it doesn't matter that you're throwing him a bit more information? It's not hurting anyone, right?<br><br> If all of that seems too good to be true-the friendship, the money, the tennis club-you're right. SEBASTIAN has expertly spotted someone with access, found his vulnerabilities, developed him, and recruited him to be a spy.<br><br><i> Spies Are the Best Salespeople in the World</i><br><br> What do spies really do? They recruit people who have information that the U.S. government feels can be beneficial to our national security. The United States might learn that a foreign government is developing a dangerous weapon and we need to learn more about it to keep our citizens safe. Or maybe we suspect a terrorist cell is planning to harm Americans. In that case we might need to infiltrate a foreign country to gather boots- on-the-ground information so we can stop the threat.<br><br> Or, as a former intelligence officer who worked for many years as a case officer puts it:<br><br> "We're salesmen. We're just selling a different product, and that product is treason."<br><br> As you might imagine, treason is not an easy product to sell. Case officers are highly trained in the art of clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting. HUMINT is simply any information that can be gathered from human sources. Case officers recruit people who live or work in a foreign country to be spies for the U.S. government. The cycle that case officers routinely use follows a progression of spotting, assessing potential recruits, development, and then recruitment. Once the individual is recruited, he or she is officially known as an "agent" and works closely with the case officer to provide information for the United States in return for some sort of compensation. If you're thinking that being an agent sounds a lot like being a spy, you're absolutely right. While "agent" is the official term used in espionage, the bottom line is that "agent" is just a more technical term for "spy." So both the CIA officer and the person recruited are spies.<br><br><i> Spotting: Who Are We Looking For?</i><br><br> How exactly does a regular person end up committing treason against their home country and spying for the U.S. government? Who are we looking for? Does this person have any particular skills? If you think the United States is looking for someone who is great with a firearm and can easily handle a wild car chase, you're mistaken. The right agent is going to have a few essential qualities, but the number one thing a case officer is looking for in an agent is a person with access. The potential agent must have a connection to someone who has information that the U.S. government cannot get on its own. Without access, there's no point. As you'll soon see, academics and researchers often possess very valuable information about chemicals, weapons, computer programs, and encryption systems that different countries want to get their hands on. In that case, these people have access to valuable information. A person may also be desirable because they have access to technology. It's also possible that a case officer will recruit someone because they have relationships with certain high-level individuals. They may be close friends with a diplomat, or with someone who works in the military. People who can travel freely between one country and a "hostile" country may also have access. They can spend time in a country the United States cannot easily explore, and can pick up information and bring it back.<br><br><i> Assessing a Recruit</i><br><br> A case officer has found someone with excellent access to power players who have information the United States wants. That's a great start, but it's not enough. Any potential recruit must be assessed before the cycle moves forward. It must be determined that the person being assessed isn't under surveillance from his own country, and isn't working for that country's counterintelligence. The potential recruits who are thought to be the highest risk are the ones that defect-who show up at the American embassy offering to give information in exchange for being allowed asylum in the United States. Extra precautions must be taken to make sure that this person wasn't sent by his own country, pretending to want asylum.<br><br> Other risks also have to be ruled out, such as is the person likely able to handle the challenges of the job? Will they be able to handle the training? Will they be able to master basic tradecraft such as signaling, brush passes, and dead drops? In a best-case scenario, any agent we recruit will be reasonable and calm. Obviously, spying is dangerous and can have huge consequences, ranging from jail time to execution. If the agent is reasonable and easy to deal with, there's a better chance that they won't get caught. Unfortunately, rational people aren't always the ones who decide to become spies. Money problems, revenge, and anger are sometimes reasons a person decides to spy for the United States. A person who is motivated by these things might be less trustworthy and harder to handle-and therefore much more likely to get caught.<br><br><i> Developing and Recruiting</i><br><br> In the stories that follow, we'll go in-depth into the development-and-recruiting cycle. When a case officer develops an asset, he's doing everything in his power to develop a good rapport and set up a scenario where the asset feels comfortable sharing secrets. As one of my CIA buddies likes to say, "I know I'm developing someone properly when he feels I'm the only person in the world who truly understands him, and that's when he's ready to be officially recruited." Once an agent is recruited, he's an actual witting spy for the U.S. government, and that's when the big challenges (and fun and excitement) really begin.<br><br> ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS PEOPLE AGREE TO SELL THEIR COUNTRY'S SECRETS TO THE UNITED STATES<br><br> There are many reasons a person might decide to sell their country's secrets to the United States. Money is an obvious reason. Having large debts or not enough money to get by on can put people in a desperate situation. Some people are looking to add a sense of excitement to their lives, or they share a strong personal philosophy with the United States. It's also possible they are hoping to obtain a visa into the United States for themselves or their family. But if you ask a bunch of spies what the number one reason is, you're going to get an answer that just might surprise you. Education. One of the most attractive carrots to dangle in the espionage game is the promise of a fully funded top-notch education for a recruit's son or daughter at one of America's finest colleges or universities.</p><h2>Batman: Sword of Azrael</h2><p>This paperback collects the Batman: Sword of Azrael storyline which was written by Dennis O&#39;Neil and illustrated by Joe Quesada and Kevin Nowlan. It was published from October, 1992 to January, 1993 in its own comic book mini-series Batman: Sword of Azrael. The series introduces Azrael, who becomes a prominent figure in the Knightfall crossover.</p><p>Dennis &#34;Denny&#34; O&#39;Neil is a comic book writer and editor, principally for Marvel Comics and DC Comics in the 1970s. His best works include Green Lantern/Green Arrow and Batman with Neal Adams, The Shadow with Mike Kaluta and The Question with Denys Cowan, all of which were hailed for sophisticated stories that expanded the artistic potential of the mainstream portion of the medium. As an editor, he is principally known for editing Batman. His 1970s run on Batman is perhaps his most well known endeavour, turning Batman from the campiness of the 1960s TV show, to &#34;The Batman&#34;, getting back to the character&#39;s darker roots and emphasizing his detective skills. This grimer and more sophisticated Dark Knight, as well as new villians such as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, brought back Batman from the verge of pop culture oblivion. His work would influence later incarnations of Batman, from the seminal comic &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&#34; by Frank Miller, to the movie Batman Begins in 2005.</p><h2>Dracula: The Ultimate, Illustrated Edition of the World-Famous Vampire Play</h2><p>There are few figures who have towered over modern theater as predominantly as has the King of the Undead.

Hay and Nicolay were the gatekeepers of the Lincoln legacy. They read poetry and attendeded the theater with the president, commiserated with him over Union army setbacks, and plotted electoral strategy. They were present at every seminal event, from the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation to Lincoln&#x2019;s delivery of the Gettysburg Address&#x2014;and they wrote about it after his death. In their biography of Lincoln, Hay and Nicolay fought to establish Lincoln&#x2019;s heroic legacy and to preserve a narrative that saw slavery&#x2014;not states&#x2019; rights&#x2014;as the sole cause of the Civil War.

Morgan Llywelyn, the acclaimed historical writer of books like <i>Lion of Ireland, Bard </i>and <i>The Horse Goddess</i>, is the writer born to bring this epic battle to life. Having created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, she now turns to recent Irish history to create a multivolume saga: <i>The Irish Century.</i><br><br><i>1921 </i>tells the story of the Irish War of Independence and the heartbreaking civil war that followed. Henry Mooney, a reporter for the<i>Clare Champion</i> and the <i>Irish Bulletin</i>, is a self-described "moderate nationalist" who struggles to see the truth in the news of the day, and to report it fairly. Lacking more radical Republican beliefs of his dear friends Ned Halloran and Sile Duffy, Henry reports the political--and later, bloody--actions of his fellow Irishman from the ashes of the failed 1916 Rising to the creation of the Irish Free State to the tragic and wide-ranging battles of the Irish Civil War.<br><br>Meanwhile, Henry feels the impact of these history-changing events in his own personal life. His friendship with Ned falters when their political beliefs diverge, and an unexpected tragedy leaves them further apart than ever. Henry struggles with his passion for a well-bred Protestant Anglo-Irish woman, Ella Rutledge, and as he dutifully reports the events in the political battle for independence, he comes to realize that the Irish struggle for freedom wil leave no life untouched--and no Irish citizen with a dry eye or an untroubled heart.<br></p><p>Since 1980 Morgan Llywelyn has created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, from the earliest times to the present day. her critically acclaimed novels, both of history and of mythology, have been translated into many languages. She is an Irish citizen and lives in Dublin.<br>Llywelyn's second novel in the series she inaugurated with 1916 (1998) furthers her investigation of Irish history by focusing on Ireland's struggle for freedom from Britain. This volume begins in 1917 in the aftermath of the Easter Rising and carries through to the civil war and the establishment of the Republic of Ireland. That Llywelyn knows her Irish history, culture, language and ambience is unquestionable. Unfortunately, in her attempt to amalgamate her encyclopedic knowledge of Ireland with the fictional adventures of Henry Mooney, a journalist torn between the traditional demands of family and personal ambition and his commitment to his country, she produces a story that is as dense as an Irish bog and nearly as confusing to navigate. Henry, a supporter of the Republican cause but a political moderate and neutral observer by nature, moves with alacrity among the various factions, apparently enjoying journalistic immunity as he uses his pen to further the Irish cause and attack the British. As the situation in the country deteriorates, Henry's personal life becomes more complex. Smitten with passionate S�le Halloran, but unable to possess her since she is the wife of his best friend and Easter veteran Ned (protagonist of 1916), Henry falls in love with beautiful Anglo-Irish siren Ella Rutledge, further dividing his loyalties. Often sliding into essayistic prose, with footnotes supplementing the text, the novel depicts events and political developments in exhaustive detail. Though the account of the civil war is thorough and nuanced, readers of 1916 and other popular books by Llywelyn (Lion of Ireland; Bard, etc.) may be taken aback by the historical heft of this offering. (Mar.)Forecasts: Llywelyn is a popular writer and this book won't hurt her sales record, boosted as it will be by an excerpt in the mass market edition of The Last Prince of Ireland (due out March 1), an eight-city author tour, national ad/promo and the availability of a reading group guide (the book is caboosed by 17 pages of source notes and bibliography). <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Quick &amp; Easy Japanese Cuisine for Everyone (Quick &amp; Easy Cookbooks Series)</h2><p>Even those unfamiliar with Japanese cooking can follow the steps in this book and feel confident in achieving great tasting, authentic results.</p><p>Y Moriyama is a Kodansha International author.</p><h2>Farm: A Year in the Life of an American Farmer</h2><p>This book has no scholarly paraphernalia at all a departure for the author of the meticulously researched, Pulitzer Prize-winning history The Making of the atomic bomb .

Portland, Or.</p><p><i>Farm</i> lyrically recounts a year in the lives of Tom and Sally Bauer, solid Midwesterners who work the bottomlands of the Missouri River to grow "a harvest few city people could have identified ... the foundation of their diet, the principal food plant of the Western world": corn. The two rise before dawn in all kinds of weather, tending to the hundreds of tasks farmers must master in the face of heavy odds--foreclosures, climbing interest rates, a then-sickening economy, and, always, the uncertainties of the weather and the health of their crops.
